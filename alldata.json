          " Second volume by Rev. George Jerment. Preface by\n       George Jerment dated Weston Place, May 23, 1804: \"among the British\n       writers on this subject, the late Dr. Gibbons holds the most eminent\n       place. His two volumes are here compressed into one, the less\n       important or extraneous matter in his collection being omitted. Some, though very few, of the\n        lives in his volumes are, for the same reason, entirely left out\"\n       (ital in orig; x). Jerment used \"various sources\" for second volume, and only wrote a few\n       himself. Whereas Gibbons's original 2-vol. work included only subjects who were English and\n       \"in high life,\" Jerment's second volume includes \"NINE Scots women,\n       of various ranks, who were remarkably pious\" (x-xi). 2 pp. catalogue\n       at end: Ogle in London, Glasgow; Ogle and Aikin, Edinburgh, mostly sermons.

Davenport is identified as Author of \"The Artic World, the\n        Mediterranean Illustrated, the Bird-World, etc.\" Dedicated \"The the Right Hon. the Countess\n        of Glasgow these volumes are by permission respectfully and gratefully dedicated by the\n        author.\"\n       Adams's Preface submits to “'general reader’” reading that should be “pleasant and not\n        unprofitable” for “leisure hour,” concerning “the character of Woman as she appears in the\n        world of Literature and Society” (capitalized in original). The subjects were “chosen\n        because they are representative.\" It is \"needless to dwell on the strong moral and\n        intellectual distinctions which separate a Harriet Martineau from a Lady Mary Wortley\n        Montagu, or a Charlotte Brontë from a Countess of Blessington.” umlaut The “present volumes\n        are confined to English Representative Women; but should they meet with a favourable\n        reception from the reading public, the writer on another occasion may venture further\n        afield.” \"January 1878\" (vii-viii) \n       Throughout biographies, a horizontal line sets off the header of each page, Representative\n        Women (verso), subject's name (recto). First page of each gives subject's name in large caps\n        followed by a period and \"A.D. 1753-1821\" (Inchbald) or the appropriate birth and death\n        dates. The narratives are divided into chapters.\n       Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's biography consumes 149 pages, followed by a summary page in\n        smaller type giving her name, dates of birth (1690) and death (1762), quoting at length from\n        “Dallaway,” who favorably compares Montagu's learning with other women's. She “applied her\n        learning to improve her knowledge of the world…\" She showed best in her \"purity of style,\n        rather than in the ambition of displaying her acquirements…\" She gave \"grace of expression\n        and novelty to maxims…” (150). Other subjects do not receive such a concluding page \"blurb.\"\n        For comparison, Burney or “Frances D’Arblay” [sic] receives five chapters (124 pp.). \n       The biography of Elizabeth Inchbald begins, “We have now to tell the story of a Woman who\n        in some respects may fairly be considered Representative, though she made no very\n        conspicuous figure in what is known as Society, and does not occupy a very high position in\n        the republic of Letters. Her life was more remarkable than her works, and her character is a\n        more interesting study than her life. Yet had she possessed less of marked individuality,\n        and had her career permitted fewer noticeable incidents, she must still have been remembered\n        as a dramatist of some ability, and a novelist of no mean order” (125) \n       “Marguerite, Countess of Blessington, once so famous in London Society, though now little\n        more than the shadow of a name, was the third child…\" begins Blessington's biography (176).\n        Chapter iv:“Lady Blessington’s literary career was not, as we have seen, a successful one”\n        (253). After a slash on p. 263, “A few words may be added respecting Count D’Orsay\" (263-4),\n        a unique supplement comparable to Dallaway's words on Montagu. \n       As to Adams's authority and objectivity, he gets some facts wrong and judges by strict\n        gender and religious standards. Charlotte Brontë's dates are given 1817-1855 instead of\n        1816-1855. The biography begins: \"The Rev. Patrick Blundell, who afterwards assumed the name\n        of Brontë, was a native of the county of Down in Ireland” (265). The three sisters become\n        subjects: Charlotte's \"life was so mixed up with the lives of her sisters, that the threads\n        cannot be wholly disentangled….\" Perhaps with Gaskell in mind, Adams opines, \"We are great\n        believers in the power of circumstances to shape and modify character; and we believe that\n        the sights and sounds…in our childhood produce each a strong impression” (266-7). “We feel\n        the breath of the strong Yorkshire breezes in her style….Haworth was hardly the place in\n        which a lyrist of the Thomas Moore stamp could have grown up and sung; hardly the place to\n        have nourished a ‘Wild Irish Girl’ or an ‘Evelina.’ But it was no unfitting home for a ‘Jane\n        Eyre’” (267). The biography concludes with Harriet Martineau’s famous obituary assessment of\n        Charlotte as having the “conscientiousness of a saint” (342). \n       In her own biography, Adams grants: “Harriet Martineau, as all will admit, was a\n        remarkable woman; remarkble by virtue of her mental endowments; remarkable for force of\n        character; remarkable in her long and active career; and remarkable in her ready acceptance\n        of the crude speculations of an inferior mind; but remarkable, beyond everything, for her\n        egotism” of \"sublime proportions\" (343). Adams quotes W. R. Greg, “Qu’elle avait le défauts\n        de ses qualités” (344), dwelling further on Martineau's denial of merit in other people and\n        her conviction that \"the world...floated round her own individuality” (348). “As a novelist\n        she cannot be ranked with George Eliot, Charlotte Brontë, or even Mrs. Gaskell. Her strength\n        lay in logical force of statement and appositeness of illustration” (348). After this\n        extensive assessment of Martineau's standing, Adams states that his sketch of her life is\n        based on the \n         Autobiography\n        , which he faults: it is “amusing to perceive the evident belief that the reader\n        will dwell as eagerly as she herself dwelt upon even the minutest particulars of her\n        childhood” (349). “It would be uncharitable to criticize too severely the moribund\n        utterances of a woman in Harriet Martineau’s physical condition” (393). Agnoticism is a\n        “miserable creed” (393). \n      "],

Thirty-nine subjects, including Lillie Langtry, the Beaton\n       sisters, Miss Edith Sitwell, Mrs. Virginia Woolf, Miss Tallulah Bankhead, Miss Lilian Gish,\n       Miss Norma Shearer, Miss Greta Garbo, Miss Gertrude Lawrence, Miss Anita Loos, Lady Cunard.\n       Some women of rank. “Unlike other children, my greatest heroines were not the Maid of Orleans\n       or the Lady of the Lamp [sic], but Lily Elsie, Gabrielle Ray and Queen Alexandra” (1). “There\n       will be disagreement about my choice. . . far from complete” (3). This “is the first attempt\n       at an up-to-date version of the old books of beauty” with their stylized scenes “unreal but\n       divinely pretty” (4). In modern times, women reincarnate famous types: “Mrs. Peter Thursby as\n       our Nell Gwynne, Lady Juliet Duff as Mrs. Siddons; Lady Hamilton imitated the plastic poses\n       of Cleo, Agrippina and Diana [sic], and Lady Lavery poses as Lady Hamilton. But how many of\n       these beauties . . . will make history?” (5). “Mrs. Virginia Woolf is one of the most gravely\n       distinguished-looking women I have ever seen. . . . She has all the chaste and sombre beauty\n       of village schoolmistresses, housekeepers, and nuns. . . . one realises that a face can be a\n       reverend and sacred thing”: a heroine like Mrs. Dalloway, unsuited to makeup (37-38).

The very familiar story of Lady Hamilton (Admiral Nelson's mistress)\n       may be welcomed as a favorite \"in a gallery mostly given up to strangers\" (6)—possibly indicating that Lola Montez \n       was being revived in the early twentieth century. The \"Preliminary Discourse\" concludes with the opinion that these women were\n       resourceful within their time's subordination of women; \"You can decide for yourself which were the adventuresses and which the \n       adventurous ladies\" (14).

So far, therefore, from greater freedom\n       and better education encouraging women to neglect womanly work, it has caused them to apply\n       themselves to it more systematically and more successfully. The names of Elizabeth Fry, Mary\n       Carpenter, Sarah Martin, Agnes Jones, Florence Nightingale, and Sister Dora are a proof of\n       this. I believe that we owe their achievements to the same impulse which in another kind of\n       excellence has given us Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, and Elizabeth Browning\" (v)."],

          "\n       British Library copy with the first title, likely to be circa 1870. See title 678 (Mrs.\n        Clyde Robertson, 1936). One catalogue has “1830-1850?,” unlikely dates given Charlotte\n        Bronte's presence in the known tables of contents (famous after 1847, but entering\n        biographies after her death and Gaskell's biography 1855-1857). “Sketches,” including some\n        negative examples: “many a wasted life, and many a career exhibiting only mistaken activity\n        . . . carries with it its lesson” (iii-iv). First-person anonymous introduction offers the\n        collection as answer to the question, “What is really woman's work?”(2). The subjects show\n        that heriosm belongs “with duty and work” they are “types of a class--chosen\n        representatives. . . from the mass of that great army of female heroism, whose rank and file\n        lie buried, unremembered and unchronicled, in nameless graves beneath the quiet churchyard\n        grass”(4). \n       In the edition owned by University of Western Ontario, significant variation appears: a\n        different TOC (as noted), and the following two-page Preface: \"In this gallery of\n        “Fifty Famous Women,” it is intended to present lifelike sketches, if not finished\n        portraits, of those who have attained celebrity by their own talents or been born to\n        emininent positions, and have exhibited qualities which made them memorable. Varied in\n        character as in the positions occupied, the fifty shosen are representatives of the large\n        number who as princesses, authoresses, philanthropists, or leaders of society have done\n        honour to their sex; and representatives too of those whose sad histories ecited universal\n        interest, although their own characters may have been marked by errors and weaknesses.\n       \"Humanity is never perfect, and to find fifty persons of either sex for whom we must feel\n        unqualified admiration would be difficult; but the lives we have selected for illustration\n        are those of women whose careers may be profitably studied, and many of whom may be takene\n        as models to be studied and imitated by the young.\n       \"In these days, when the claim of women to a larger share in public and professional\n        duties is so earnestly advanced, and their social and intellectual position is so warmly\n        discussed, it will probably be interesting to note the abilities or virtues, the genius or\n        enterprise of Fifty Famous Women, who may be considered as representatives of their sex.\n        Among them we shall find illustrations of talent, devotion, liberality, and thoughtfulness,\n        which entitle them to a place in the ranks of those whom all the world honour.\" \n       The U Western Ontario copy indicates its later-Victorian origon with is blue cloth cover\n        stamped with black and red geometric patterns intertwined with red-blossomed black branches.\n        On the spine the title and publisher’s name appear in gold bands; on the front cover, the\n        title only, with the sort of art-nouveau detailing that might border a Beardsley print. The\n        frontispiece is an engraving, \"Mrs. Siddons as the Tragic Muse.\" The type and illustrations\n        are of poor quality; wood-engraved headpieces and tailpieces appear in most chapters, some\n        of the standard-issue irrelevant sort. Some illustrations feature biographical scenes or\n        places, and there are some full-page portraits or historic scenes (rotated) throughout. Some\n        chapters have no portrait. The most telling feature is a book catalogue at the back, by\n        price; first, “The Cheapest Standard Books Published” \"Ward & Lock’s Shilling Library of\n        Famous Books for All Time” (1 page), including J.C. Watt’s\n        Great Novelists, of 1880, and H. J. Nicoll’s\n           Life of Thomas Carlyle\n        , first published in 1881 (the year of Carlyle's death). A second\n        section features “Gift Books at Three Shillings & Sixpence” in two lists: “The Home\n        Treasure Library” (1 page, mostly with coloured illustrations, fiction) and “The Good Worth\n        Library” (2 pages), including most relevantly, Fifty Celebrated Women: Their Virtues and\n        Failings, and the Lessons of Their Lives” and Fifty Celebrated Men:Their Lives and Trials,\n        and the Deeds that Made Them Famous. Some fiction, some other bio collections: Famous Boys.\n        Mary Bunyan, the Daughter of John Bunyan, by Sallie Rochester Ford Bios of President\n        Garfield, of General Gordon; lots of advice and self help “Famous People and Famous Places”\n        “Sacred Heroes and Martyrs” by JT Headley \n      "],

Red cloth binding.  \"Dedicated to my dear little Granddaughter Benita\" in small caps.\n      Epigraph from Maurice Baring: \"Nevertheless new cities shall arise and new shapes of beauty, and son that \n      shall seem to the hearers immortal, until the world itself shall end.  And when the word is ended there shall be new worlds, and these\n      too shall live and die, eternal and punctual, even as the blossoms of spring.\"  Foreword dated\n      November 12, 1927, by Rosetta Fairfax, pp. 7-9: \"It has been a labour of love to write a foreword for\n      this last book of my dear mother.  The MS. was in Messrs. Hutchinson's hands when she passed\n      away peacefully on February 8th of this year....[T]he modern practice of having books written\n      by paid professionals is one which I find repellent....In the last few months of her life\n      my mother was disappointed at her inability to get photographs of some of the various Queens\n      of whose lives she was writing\" (7).  Fairfax leaves the text largely unaltered, adds photographs,\n      and apologizes for the many unattributed quotations in her mother's biographies \"compiled\n      from rough notes\" of books Fairfax has been unable to retrieve (8-9).  Author's Note: the book was written to refute\n      the idea \"that women have never accomplished anything really great in any branch of the world's work.  In England this may\n      have been true to a certain extent prior to the passing of the Married Women's Property Act of 1870\" (11).  Her selection\n      of Eastern women \"have been chosent\" to show \"to what heights the women of the Asiatic, African, and Polynesian races\n      can rise, given the opportunity, though they are frequently rather disparagingly spoken of as 'poor down-trodden Orientals'\n      or 'natives'\" (12). Preface ostensibly \n      by Glover: \"...I have discarded mere tradition as far as possible, and the following\n      sketches of the lives of notable women rulers are founded on fact....I have been most forcibly\n      struck by the colossal importance of the female throughout Nature.\"  Motherhood warrants woman's \"responsibility.\"\n      A long paragraph attests to the intelligence of the elephant, and dominance of \"the Queen Elephant,\" followed\n      by a short rhetorical question/paragraph on the queen bee.  History shows \"how notably prosperous Britain has \n      always been under the sovereignty of a Queen\" (16).  Contents organized under India, China, Japan, Palmyra,\n      Assyria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Abyssinia, New Zealand, Hawaii, South Sea Islands.  Those named Begam in the table of\n      contents are listed under \"The Rulers of Bhopal.\"  Eleven portraits, including frontispiece\n      of The Dowager Empress of China.  The prose of the biographies is unremarkable modern historical narrative.  \n      \"It is difficult to understand the Oriental mind and its outlook on life, so imbued is it with the spirit\n      of the past, with ritual, and with superstitions absolutely unthinkable by the practical and progressive European....\n      little can be really known of the inner workings of a country like China\" (147).

          "NOT:=argument based on biblical interpretation and testimonials or autobiographies of \"modern\" women preachers.  Title page: Mrs. Fannie McDowell Hunter, Fulton, Kentucky.  Introduced by Dr. A. M. Hills, President Texas Holiness University,\n      Peniel, Texas.  Price 25 cents.  Hunter's photograph with signature is the frontispiece.  About 100-pp. book with portraits, no table of contents. A dedication \"To \n      My Beloved Sisters\" indicates that women on blessed missions for the Master \"often meet the opposition and scorn of their opponents.\"  Hunter's preface (one page)\n      affirms the biblical support for the right of women to preach.  Hills in his one-page introduction approves the book as the best (\"unanswerable\") argument for \n      the right of women to preach.  \"The author is herself a preacher of righteousness of extended usefulness, known in many States...May many saintly women\n      be encouraged by the reading of these pages to be obedient to their Heavenly vision.\"  Chapters tracing women preachers in Old and New Testaments and refuting the \n      objections lead to chapter four, \"Modern Women Preachers,\" which quickly moves to Methodists and the Salvation Army (43-45), mentioning specific women such as Mrs. \n      Fletcher. In a paragraph, a former slave Amanda Smith is praised as a preacher (47).  Hunter's autobiographical sketch (beginning p. 48) leads a series of first-person\n      life narratives, usually beginning with a portrait, e.g. \"My Call to Preach./Mrs. Eliza J. Rutherford.  An Ordained Preacher of the Methodist Protestant Church.\" (65). \n      These narratives sometimes appear as new chapters, but chapter five is Conclusion.  \"This may be well-called woman's age,\" Hunter writes after citing the example of Jane\n      Addams. Women participate in almost all occupations. When they can vote, they will pass Prohibition.  \"Since woman owes her elevation to Christianity, may she show her appreication\n      by rallying around the Cross\" (96-98). The volume concludes with a verse debate between blaming Eve for the Fall and blaming Old Adam for misleading her, men for the crucifixion and\n      praising women for their saving role.\n      "],

          " Riches. G.P.R. James was a prolific historical\n       novelist. Anna Comnena was the daughter of Alexius I (Comnenus) emperor of Constantinople, b.\n        1081/83; she wrote her father's life; Queen Elizabeth [longest bio]; Donna\n       Maria Pacheco was the wife of Padilla of Toledo, a Castilian leader of the rebellion against\n       Charles V; after his execution, she led pageantry to oppose the king and defended her city\n       under siege, finally fleeing to Portugal in disguise. Queen Elizabeth's biography is the\n       longest in the volume. British Library stamp 15 OC 75. Illustrations consist of 1) Frontis:\n       Ghoulish George Cruikshank engraving of “The Execution of Jane”: hatchet raised over the head\n       of a bug-eyed, masked executioner, blindfolded woman kneeling, neck exposed, in mid-Victorian\n       dress, as Elizabethan soldiers watch ; 2) “Execution of Joan of Arc” (58); 3) “Margaret of\n       Anjou and the Robber” (124); 4) “Elizabeth's Childhood” [popular image of child Elizabeth\n       reading with two ladies] (272). “That a female warrior, even inspired by enthusiastic love\n       for her country, should perform deeds, of which the most celebrated generals of the age might\n       have been proud, appears more like the fiction of the poet than a transaction of real life;\n       yet such was the case with Joan of Arc”( 7; opening line of text).

Short preface; \"A young lady might, from reading the life\n      of Hannah Moore, be desirous of imitating her ardent desire of instructing the poor; she might attend a Sunday School\n      for that purpose, and, for trying to benefit others, God might reward her by blessing his word to her own soul\" (iv).  The \n      examples instill the \"virtues, which every mother would be delighted to see blossoming...\" while the book aims \"to amuse, instruct,\n      and edify Young Ladies\" (v).  At the close of Lady Jane Grey's biography a horizontal line marks off direct address: \"And\n      now, my dear young friends, reflect, I entreat you, upon the information to be derived from the perusal of my little volume.\"  Specific\n      comments on each subject leads to the summation, \"make the Bible your guide\" and a final couplet commending a heavenly reward for good\n      conduct (210-16).\n      "],

Kohut is repeatedly\n       identified with \"New York City.\"  Dedication \"to/ Frau Ruth Lazarus/ (Nahida Remy)/ The inspired champion of/ Israel's\n       Rights and Religion,/ whose genius and womanly sympathies/ are now forever enlisted in/ The Cause of Jewish Emancipation,/\n       this list of martyrs of her sex, for/ whom she has so nobly pleaded/ in history, art and literature,/ is gratefully inscribed by/\n       the writer.\"  Centered, with mixture of larger and smaller caps and lower case.  Pages 3-9 are two-column text: introduction\n       followed by alphabetical paragraphs on 67 Jewish women from Spain and Portugal who died in the Spanish Inquisition, followed \n       by 63 notes on pages 8 and 9. Kohut refers to various recent books on \"Israel's noble women,\" including a psychological\n       study on the \"Jewish Woman\" by Nahida Remy, now Mrs. Lazarus. Kohut treats \"Jewish Woman\" as a singular (\"She suffered much\") before\n       inviting \"us\" to \"tarry awhile in the gloomy shades of the merciless past and witness the heroism of Israel's women, who, not\n       in intellect, but in virtue, sought to glorify their creed and to hallow the name of their Creator!\" (3).  The entries\n       simply identify the individuals (\"wife of\" etc.) and the record of their punishment, often in cross reference (continuing prose) to the\n       preceding entry or shared fates at particular spectacles of auto-da-fe.  \n       Published in the journal American Jewess, \n       Volume II, Number 1, pages 43-48; Full text available \n       online athttp://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/amjewess/taj1895.0002.001/55:16?didno=TAJ1895.0002.001;page=root;rgn=full+text;size=100;view=image (10 June 2011).

Luckett, \"Editor and Publisher,\" appears to have signed each title page; this is supported by the bookplates\n      of the Library of the University of Virginia: \"Presented by Mrs. Edmund Boone Luckett\" (typed).  She appears in the frontispiece of the third volume, captioned Mrs. Edmond Boone Luckett, The Author, where in volume one Queen Henrietta\n      Maria and in volume two Queen Anne appeared. Each volume is dedicated to one of Mrs. Luckett's daughters.  The third volume differs in a glossy insert\n      between copyright and dedication pages: the lyrics to the Star-Spangled Banner, facing a color image of the flag above the Pledge of Allegiance.  This\n      seems likely to be prompted by the war ongoing in 1942.  The brief \"Foreword\" to v. 3 states: \"Responding to a continued demand for Maryland Women,\n      the author has compiled the third volume; this volume before leaving the press has been ordered by different universities, to be placed by volume 1 and volume\n      2 as reference books.  The author has derived great pleasure in the contact of these native and adopted Maryland Women.  To quote Carlyle, who said, 'he \n      would give more for a single picture of a man than all the books that might be written of him.'\"  Short alphabetical entries (indexed) take very different \n      forms, suggesting self- or family-contributed bios, most with glossy photographs of the subject.  The contents appear almost entirely distinct in each\n      volume, though the daughter Elise Luckett Balsam, featured in volume one, has an obituary in volume three (sadly inserted with her beautiful portrait\n      and paginated \"6A\"), and one Mrs. John Nicholas Brown (Anne Kinsolving), misplaced in the alphabet at the very end of volume one, reappears 3: 23.  These\n      appear all to be white women; some could be Jewish, though this is not remarked; a number have careers in music, the arts, journalism, even sky-diving,\n      and at least one is a suffrage advocate.  Some portraits show pageantry, as women play the role of queens or the Goddess of Liberty (3: 28).  The inclusion\n      of English nobility and royalty goes along with a frequent insistence on genealogy and membership in the Daughters of the American Revolution."],

Dedication: \"To Elsbeth.\"  Facing table of contents, quoted verse: \"The hand\n      that rocks the cradle/ is the hand that rules the world.\"  After 297 pages, a two-page list, \"Sources of Information,\" and an index.\n      The portraits (listed facing page one) \"taken by permission from the Portraitsammlung der Nationalbibliothek,\" in six single-page,\n      perpendicular pairings on\n      glossy paper, some modern photographs; the list after frontispiece: Maria Theresa in Later Years; Marie Antoinette;\n      Marie Caroline; Marie Louise; Empress Elizabeth; Fanny Elssler; Marie Vetsera; Therese Krones; Josephine Gallmeyer; Kathi Schratt\n      [sic]; Pauline Metternich; Caroline Pichler.  The Preface claims that no book in any language gathers \"lives of all the more important women\n      of Vienna,\" which itself \"affords a glimpse at the medieval and modern history of the continent\" (1).  Mahan addresses types of reader:\n      the traveler, \"the men and women who love to get an interesting book and settle on the front porch, by the fireside, or perhaps propped up\n      in bed,\" or the student (1-2).  In the introduction he insists on the historical importance of women.  Only two statues of women\n      have been erected in Vienna, but \"some of the men who now stand in plumed and petrified glory about the public places of Vienna, \n      were no better than some of the women whose names are not usually mentioned in polite society\" (4). The bad things done by men tend\n      to be omitted, not so by women. \"But in this volume the chapter headings have not been selected entirely with reference to\n      goodness and virtue.  So-called bad women have also been introduced....it will not be easy to distinguish\" which are good or bad on further\n      inquiry (5).  \"Women Who Rose from the Soil\" and \"Two Aristocrats\" are chapters including five and two biographies, respectively, as listed.",

Each section begins with the name and epithet phrase above an epigraph,\n      then the first chapter on a new page, with Date of Main Incidents in parentheses.  A paragraph on sources is followed by one headed\n      \"Leader's Thoughts on Giving the Lesson,\" with a note that \"if the lesson is taken with a Bible Class,\" the specific text should be read.\n      Right above the start of the narrative, an Introduction in bold type could be a model for what the leader says, and throughout\n      such bold interjections provide model questions to ask the class.  Sections of the story have small-caps titles guiding the response,\n      and the chapter concludes with a page of \"After the Lesson.\"  In short, this is a very thorough handy teacher's manual as well as\n      biographical anthology.  The activities of the heroines of healing are dramatically and at times realistically told amid the \n      broad statements of precept.

Her examples are chosen for fame \"beyond question\"\n       and because they \"represent their period and locality.\" The aim is to “recognize the power of\n       a queenly personality”; the hope is that the 20th c. will “‘perpetuate the\n       empire which beauty first established.’” Preface dated Paris June 22, 1900.\n       Final chapter: \"New York as Social Centre.\""],

          " Author of books on early modern England, e.g. \n        Customs of Old England\n        (1911). Part of Heroes of All Time series, which includes Snell's \n        Boys Who Became Famous\n        and Garibaldi and his Red-Shirts, along with individual male biographies as well\n       as two books by E. M. Wilmot-Buxton (one about Joan of Arc) and separate lives of Marie Antoinette, Queen Victoria, and \n       Queen Elizabeth I.  Compare S. Bolton, Jos. Johnson. A handsome leather spine with gilded sword and torch and stamped gilded pattern on front\n      cloth cover.  Color frontispiece, \"A Visit from Florence Nightingale\" to an old lady in bed; eight other narrative images in black\n      and white, e.g. Maria Edgeworth enacting a bedroom story for a group of girls, \"Thrilled by romantic narratives from her fertile\n      brain\" (16).  Preface: \"designed as a companion to a previous volume, entitled Boys who Became Famous\" (5).\n      Snell denies that there are fewer \"great women\" than men, especially since the concept of fame or greatness is elastic.  He lists\n      the biographies or autobiographies that he drew from (5-6).  Other than Joan of Arc, the list is eighteenth- and nineteenth-century,\n      centered on literature and arts, and women who wrote about their own childhoods.  The style is accessible but not that of\n      children's adventure stories; Snell discusses biographical versions, and uses \"we\" fairly often.",

          " British Library. 1851: Portrait of\n       Agnes Strickland, frontis. (J. Hayes, 1846, eng. F.C. Lewis; signed by\n       Strickland). Preface: “The actual degree of beauty represented is no positive criterion of\n       the charms of the original but depends in a great measure on the state of the arts, and the\n       ability of the” artist. The revised edition won't replace “the well-thumbed copies of the\n       first familiar editions” (ix-x). “Documentary historians alone can appreciate the\n       difficulties, the expense, the injury to health, to say nothing of the sacrifice of more\n       profitable literary pursuits. . . . The hope that the Lives of the Queens of England [sic]\n       might be regarded as a national undertaking, honourable to the female character, and\n       generally useful to society, encouraged us to the completion of the task” (x). “The queens of\n       England were not the shadowy queens of tragedy or romance. . . . They were the queens of real\n       life” xvi). Dated Reydon Hall, Suffolk, 1851, followed by engraving of Reydon\n       Hall. Introduction: “No other princess has, however, been enthroned in this land under such\n       auspicious circumstances as our present sovereign lady”--one of few queens regnant (1). “A\n       united nation uplifted in assent” at Victoria's coronation (2). Clumsy illustrations, not\n       overlapping with those in Howitt, \n         Biographical Sketches of the Queens of England\n        , also pub. in 1851. The one-volume 1867 edition New\n       York: Harper, 1867; includes the first illustration from the complete edition,\n       Matilda of Flanders., as the sole illustration. ",

          "\n       Available in a 1992 facsimile by The Methodist Publishing House.  It was edited by John A. Vickers, who added an Editorial\n       Note identifying Zachariah Taft (1772-1848) as an itinerant Wesleyan who continued to advocate women's preaching, including\n       that of his weife Mary Barritt, even when it lost its official sanction.  Taft's preface to volume one indicates that he wants \n       to preserve records that have been suppressed because most \"Biographers and Editors of Magazines, are enemies to female preaching\" (ii).\n       According to Taft, John Wesley \"knew that it made no difference whether the servant of God...was male or female\" (iii).  \"From the\n       pages of History, we learn that women have moved in the most exalted spheres, and chived the most astonishing\n       exploits\" (vi), as Taft goes on to illustrate, citing various divines. He has introduced some examples of the living.  The biographies\n       include correspondence, and may reproduce a journal (e.g. Mary Holder's pp. 101-26). End of vol. 1 lists errata; lists other books\n       by Taft, and the facsimile edition adds an appendix noting Taft's own annotations for a planned second edition.  Vol. 2 begins\n       with frontispiece portrait of Taft, another preface arguing for women's preaching (\"no female preaches for hire\" but\n       all must overcome resistance (ix-x). He notes the \"favourable reception of the first volume\" (xiv), and reprints at the beginning\n       some of the verse communications he received in response (xvi-xxi).  Chapters may begin with the name as the first words of a first\n       sentence, and/or they may have a parenthetical statement about the name in italics below the title name, e.g. Miss Sarah Eland.

John Stoughton's The Homes and Haunts of Luther); 8 unnumbered pages at the back of the volume catalogue \n       this library; no female biographies included.  Frontispiece plate shows \"A Martyr of the XVIth Century\" \n      being led down cathedral steps to public execution (Willem Geets painting).  Seven other illustrations concern persecutions.  This is an updated female counterpart to\n      the Foxe's Book of Martyrs.  Walsh in a brief preface says he tried to find \"a lady\" to collect a volume of female martyrs for Protestantism: \"women\n      have not been one whit behind their brethren in what they have endured for the love of Jesus,\" and \"the noble army of Women Martyrs\" has come for \"almost\n      every rank in life\" (v-vi). He provides more than two pages of bibliography, including James Anderson's Ladies of the Reformation.  Table of \n      Contents divided by country, and most chapters have multiple subjects.  Some of those below, e.g. France, do not list individuals but groups, and even when\n      names are listed in table of contents, the text may have little more than a paragraph or a page on the person's martyrdom.

The narratives can be in \n      present tense, second person, as in a tour of the school with introductions to the girls there, including a baby blinded because\n      she was a girl \"It is good to feel our baby girls at home are generally wanted, isn't it?\" (48).
