                        foundation-school at  Stapleton, and
                        his wife; but this same daughter was destined to become
                        world-famous, and to bring countless visitors into the neighbourhood of Bristol, both during her life and after

                        coaxing for her to obtain from her observant mother. Mrs Jacob

                        Hannah More was the fourth daughter of
                            Jacob More, village schoolmaster of Lord Bottelourt&rsquo;s

                        contrition and promises of amendment!</p>
<p class="">The
                        evangelical piety of Hannah More is rather remarkable, when one considers
                        that her father was a staunch Tory and High Churchman.
                        Perhaps it would be more correct to say that it seems remarkable at first
                        sight; for it has been noticed that a Nonconformist strain is frequently
                        productive of conspicuous piety in the families of High Church religionists.
                        Three generations had passed since the time when Jacob More's
                        ancestors had fought bravely as captains in Cromwell's army,
                        and it is probable that the precocious child heard many stirring stories of
                        their doings in the time of the Commonwealth, which intensified the personal and fiery interest
                        with which she afterwards watched the Revolution of 1793. "Coming events cast their
                            shadows before," and the nursery floor was
                        often the stage whereon, in carriages made of their high-backed chairs, the
                        child played at excursions to London,
                        and drove with her sisters "to see Bishops and Booksellers"&mdash;a curious
                        combination, when one remembers the happy experiences which
                        she subsequently enjoyed with Porteous and
                        Cadell.</p>
<p class="">
                        The following quaint advertisement occurs
                        in the Bristol newspapers of
                            March 11, 1758: </p>
<p class="block"> "At No. 6 in Trinity St. near the College Green. On Monday
                        after Easter will be opened a School for
                            young Ladies, by Mary More and Sisters, where will be carefully
                        taught French, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, and Needlework. Young Ladies
                        boarded on reasonable terms." </p>
<p class="">A few weeks later an additional line appears: "A dancing master will properly
                        attend." </p>
<p class="">At this time Hannah More was only thirteen, so that the statements as to her
                        having been a chief promoter of the school are altogether incorrect and
                        absurd. Mary More, then barely twenty-one, seems to have been
                        one of those thoroughly unselfish women of whom there are but too few; and
                        she delighted in developing the taste for languages and literature which her
                        more gifted younger sister very early evinced. The school prospered from the
                        first,&mdash;and no wonder, for the mistresses were no ordinary women; and
                        from their wise teaching scores of girls went out, strengthened in principle
                        as well as richer in knowledge, into a world where "it was the fashion to be
                        irreligious."</p>
<p class="">
                        Hannah took
                        her share in the school duties when she was old enough to do so; but at
                        twenty-two years of age a wealthy but elderly admirer appeared upon the
                        scene, and her engagement, to Mr Turner of Wraxall, was
                        doubtless a source of much satisfaction to the little circle, who in
                            1762 had moved to a large house in Park Street.The street still remains, and the house is now known as
                            "Hannah More Hall.". . . For six
                        years the curious courtship continued; but at the last moment the gentleman
                        decided that he did not feel equal to the responsibilities of matrimony,
                        and, after compensating his Amaryllis for her "blighted hopes" with an
                        annuity variously computed at &pound;200 and &pound;400 per annum, he died a
                            bachelor.
                        To the last this quaint pair entertained a "cordial respect" for each other,
                        and by his will she found herself the possessor of a legacy of &pound;1000.
                            The
                        annuity enabled her to feel independent and to devote herself to the study
                        of literature, for which she was really far more suited than to the
                        consideration of the "varying moods" of a middle-aged landowner. The literary world is
                            distinctly the richer, so that we are able honestly to rejoice at the
                            capricious conduct of the vacillating lover.</p>
<p class="">
                        Her first
                        work, <span class="subtitle "><em>The Search after Happiness</em></span>,
                        published in 1773, was an immediate success, and at once
                        secured her a footing among the distinguished writers of that day.
                            At twenty-eight the obscure schoolmaster's
                        daughter awoke to find herself famous. It was a far cry from Bristol to London in those days. George Stephenson was
                        still unborn, and the natural terrors of the journey were increased by the
                        hordes of highwaymen with which the roads were infested. It is a
                        red-letter day when, in 1773, Hannah More starts on her first
                        pilgrimage to London. Every step of the way is fraught with interest to
                        the young traveller, whose ideal, Samuel Johnson, looms in elephantine
                        grandeur as at the farther side of a great gulf. She has heard of him, read
                        of him, dreamed of him, and now she is to see her hero&mdash;the scarred, uncouth
                        scholar whose brilliant intellect could make even his enemies admire and
                        tremble and who has had the solitary glory of creating a faithful
                        biographer.</p>
<p class=""> Arrived in London, she is the cynosure
                        of all eyes; and as if to prove that Barabbas was not a
                        publisher, T. Cadell of the Strand made her the handsome offer of
                        the same remuneration for <span class="subtitle "><em>Sir Eldred of the
                                Bower</em></span> and the <span class="subtitle "><em>Bleeding
                                Well</em></span> as Goldsmith had received for the
                                <span class="subtitle "><em>Deserted Village</em></span>&mdash;"be it what
                        it might." This now "unconsidered trifle" was then much praised&mdash;and, what is
                        still more remarkable, and certainly not in the very least a matter of
                        sequence, it was also much read.</p>

<p class="block">Hannah More among the prophets and Hannah More as a

                        gets out of a book that which he himself is capable of assimilating, and Mr
                        Birrell is evidently not en rapport with his subject, and had better have
                        left his unworthy <em>Essay</em> unwritten. . .</p>
<p class="block">It has a spurious smartness about it which makes its
                        misstatements all the more distasteful to an earnest student of her time,
                        especially when coupled with a condescending air of patronage and
                        superiority which sits ill upon a man who has not done, and could not do,
                        one tithe of the work that was done by this delicate woman. . .</p>
<p class="block">As Charles Lamb whimsically said, "She is not Hany
                            More," and Mr Birrell can therefore criticize as harshly as he
                        thinks fit; but with men like Johnson, Garrick,
                            Pitt, Wesley, and Macaulay as
                        counsel for the defence, even her greatest admirers of to-day can afford to
                        smile. In his self-evident desire to be smart, he has forgotten alike the
                            "scrupulous
                            justice which belongs to critics and the delicacy towards the sex which
                            belongs to gentlemen," with which the <em>British
                            Review</em> wrote of her in 1811. To speak of an old woman
                        and a dead woman as a "huge conger-eel floundering in a sea of
                            dingy morality" may be smart writing, but its taste is
                        questionable, to say the least. The careless condescension with which, in
                        later years, he acknowledges her lineaments to be "very pleasant" is almost
                        comical, when one looks at the strong sweet
                        old face with its halo of silver curls, to which Time has but added the
                        beautiful serenity of a well-spent life.</p>
<p class="">
                        The Bristol
                        election of 1774 was very hotly contested, and the intelligent
                        and tactful sisters did their utmost to secure the return of the Whig
                        candidates, Cruger and Burke, who were
                        triumphantly declared successful by a large majority. This election, "the
                        most interesting that ever took place in Bristol," must have been a time of unwonted excitement for the
                        quiet sisterhood. . . . From 1775 her time was largely spent in
                        the very heart of Londonlife, and amid
                        all the social and intellectual gaieties which the best society afforded.
                        Her account of the trial of Elizabeth, Countess of Bristol, is
                        full of humour, and her letters are brimming with vivacity and observant
                        shrewdness, verifying her own declaration in her seventy-first year, "My temper is
                            naturally gay. This gayety even time and sickness have not much
                            impaired. I have carried too much sail. Nothing but the grace of God and
                            frequent attacks of very severe sickness could have kept me in tolerable
                            order. If I am no better with all these visitations, what should I have
                            been without them?"</p>
<p class="">Her tragedy, <span class="subtitle "><em>Percy</em></span>, was produced at
                        Covent Garden Theatre in 1777. Four thousand copies of the
                        "book o' the words" were sold in a fortnight, and the play itself had an
                        unusually long run, David Garrick taking the principal
                        character, and enriching the performance by a prologue and epilogue of his
                        own. This
                        tragedy seems to have made the greatest success of any of her plays, and
                        excited the emotions alike of rich and poor. Johnson,
                            Garrick, and Pitt united in praising it, and
                        the author's place in the literary world was definitely secured. </p>
<p class="">For several years she lived a life of adulation, but throughout it all she
                        held tight on to her Sundays, and maintained a degree of real simpleness
                        which could only be regarded as remarkable, were not her early influences
                        taken into account. The
                            Jesuits have a saying, "Give us a child to train until he be nine years
                            old, and you may do what you like with him afterwards," and of the truth
                            of this Hannah More is an example.
                        The
                        purity of her life remained untouched, and if to our modern notions she
                        sometimes appears almost "priggish," it must be remembered that the line
                        between faith and unfaith was more sharply defined in her day than it is
                        now, and she was bold to avow that "Propriety is to a woman what the
                            great Roman critic said that action is to an orator,&mdash;it is the first,
                            the second, and the third requisite."</p>
<p class="">Her Utopian schemes of reforming the
                        character of theatrical representations seems to have died with Garrick, and
                        the sight of his coffin in the same room where she had but lately witnessed
                        him performing as Macbeth, made her resolve definitely to devote her talents
                        to higher uses. Garrick was buried in 1779, amid
                        great mourning and splendid pomp, in the great Abbey of Westminster, but on the very night of his
                        funeral the play-houses were as crowded as if no such thing had occurred,
                        and the mourners of the day shared in all the revelries of the night. Such a
                        satire upon "the fashion of this world" helped no doubt to intensify the
                        sadness of his sudden death, and from that time the brilliant life of
                        London, with all its triumphs and successes, seems to have palled upon her.
                            With a
                        woman of her nature this was no mere "phase," resulting from the painful
                        emotions of the time, but a gradual deepening of an innate piety, for which
                        thousands have had reason to be thankful.Never again did she enter a
                        theatre, even when Sarah Siddons was taking a prominent part in
                            <em>Percy</em>, and we cannot but admire the consistent
                        striving after the "highest," which is the keynote of all her subsequent
                        career.</p>
<p class="">In 1785 we see her installed as mistress of a tiny house called
                            "Cowslip Green," about ten miles
                        from Cheddar; and when in
                            1789 her sisters gave up the Park Street school and settled in Pulteney Street, Bath, she spent part of every winter with them, and part with
                            Mrs Garrick, for whom she retained the greatest affection and
                        respect. John Wesley much deprecated her retirement to the
                        country, and sent her a message more emphatic than grammatical, which runs
                        thus&mdash;</p>
<p class="block">"Tell her,"
                            said he, "to live in the world. There is her sphere of usefulness. They
                            will not let us come near them."</p>
<p class="">But retreat did not mean idleness, and, from the quiet village of Wrington, year by year issued
                        pamphlets and tracts, which circulated in millions, and were instrumental in
                        counteracting the torrent of infidel and licentious literature which
                        threatened to inundate and undermine England&mdash;her religion and her government. Realising the enormous
                        influence wielded by those in the van of society, she published an anonymous
                        pamphlet on <span class="subtitle "><em>The Religion of the Fashionable
                                World</em></span>, and, in spite of the absence of "original
                            thought and happy phrases" which Mr Birrell deplores,
                        its authorship was speedily discovered by Dr Porteous, Bishop
                        of London, who at once declared "Aut Morus, aut angelus!" Her <span class="subtitle "><em>Village Politics</em></span> was published by
                            Rivington instead of by Cadell, and under the
                        pseudonym &ldquo;Will Chip,&rdquo; in order to divert
                        suspicion from its writer, and, to her amusement and gratification, it was
                        sent to her by every post with laudatory reviews recommending its
                        propagation in her own neighbourhood. It sold by the thousands....</p>
<p class="">It was in 1789
                        that William Wilberforce visited the sisters at Cowslip Green, and during his visit an
                        immense impulse was given to their work among the poor of the neighbourhood.
                        After visiting the magnificent gorge known as "Cheddar Cliffs" he was
                        observed to be unusually silent, but in the evening he exclaimed, <em>a propos</em> of the amazing ignorance of the people
                        there, "Miss Hannah,
                                <em>something must be done</em>&mdash;if you will be at the
                            trouble, I will be at the expense."
                        This was
                        practically another turning-point in the life of Miss Hannah More; and her
                        familiarity with the cottagers, her own tireless energy and abounding
                        sympathy, enabled her to write as powerfully of "Tom White the Postilion"
                        and "Black Giles the Poacher," as she had written before in <em>Hints to a Princess</em> and <em>The
                            Manners of the Great.</em>
</p>
<p class="">But the schemes of Wilberforce and the More sisters for benefiting the
                        population met with no response from the people of that benighted region.
                        The very poor lived in a world of their own&mdash;less than half-civilised; and
                        even among the farmers, the only argument for the better education of the
                        children that had any effect was that "while they were at Sunday-school they
                        could not be robbing orchards." But these women
                        worked on undauntedly&mdash;through evil and good report&mdash;with the energy of the
                        Old and the sweetness of the New Dispensation, until schools and scholars
                        were alike established, and out of a seeming Chaos order and discipline were
                        evolved.</p>
<p class="">"Something must be
                            done," Wilberforce had said, and "Miss Hannah" did it. She aimed at
                        the highest, but protested most strongly against making the poor into
                        philosophers. Her desire to keep them
                            in their proper place is now out of fashion, and the School Boards of
                                1906 would scoff at the short and simple lessons of
                                1799.
                        Her
                        theory was, "suitable education for each and
                            Christian education for all," and the wedding-present for a girl who was
                            married from Hannah More's
                                schools was "a pair of white stockings knitted by herself, five
                            shillings, and a Bible."</p>
<p class="">In 1802 the house now known as Barley Wood was finished, and thither the five sisters repaired,
                        living happily together as they had done in the old days, to the admiring
                        surprise of Dr Johnson, whose acquaintance she had so coveted
                        nearly thirty years before. To Barley
                            Wood often resorted many leaders of the "Clapham Sect." Henry
                            Thornton, Zachary Macaulay,
                        Wilberforce, and others were gladly welcomed to its
                        old-fashioned hospitalities by the five ladies, now no longer young, who had
                        permanently fixed their abode within its walls.</p>
<p class="">Thence issued the series of "Cheap Repository Tracts" published by the
                        S.P.C.K., which had an enormous circulation, and which show that
                            "Patty" also had a sprightly fancy and a ready pen. This sister
                        we may fairly suppose to have been the most akin to "Miss Hannah," as hers
                        is the name which occurs most frequently in connection with the social and
                        literary interests of the latter; but all the five, in their devotion to one
                        another, are perhaps unique in domestic annals. Of these tracts the most
                        popular was <em>The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain</em>, the
                        hero of which was modelled on a man whom she herself had met. The extraordinary
                        sale of 1,000,000 copies shows its admirable suitability to, and popularity
                        with, the class for whom it, as well as the other tracts, was written.</p>
<p class="">The atmosphere of Barley Wood was often enlivened by visits from
                            Zachary Macaulay's son, little Thomas
                            Babington, afterwards Lord Macaulay. . . It was Hannah More who
                        first started Lord Macaulay's library, writing to advise him, when only six
                        years old, to "lay a
                            little tiny corner-stone" for the same. She was said to have had
                        the rare gift of knowing how to live with both young and old, and she often
                        kept Macaulay with her for weeks together, the youthful prodigy meanwhile
                        declaiming poetry and reading prose by the hour. His subsequent appreciation
                        of moral goodness and his persevering energy in acquiring knowledge may be
                        fairly traced to the influences of his childhood; but his "negativism" on
                        religious subjects is a matter of surprise and regret, and his old friend of
                        Barley Wood so deeply felt his defection "from the party of the saints to the party of the
                            Whigs," as Mr Maurice significantly says, that she
                        changed her intention of leaving him her own valuable library, as a
                        testimony of her disapproval.</p>
<p class="">With little
                        outward eventfulness flowed on those next few years, save for the inevitable
                        visits of death, until in 1819 the last blow was struck in the
                        passing away of Patty, whose loving co-operation and care had cheered every
                        step of her career from the time when the little sisters had sung themselves
                        to sleep in the nursery bed at Stapleton&hellip;</p>
<p class="">Unfitted by ill-health, temperament, and having to cope with the
                        deceitfulness of servants, she determined to move into Clifton, and in a smaller house, with a fresh staff of
                        servants, to begin another chapter of her life&mdash;at eighty-three years of age.
                        Three days a-week, from twelve to three o'clock, were set apart for the
                        reception of visitors, and when remonstrated with for thus fatiguing
                        herself, the unselfish old lady had always four reasons ready, which she
                        considered unanswerable&mdash;If old, she saw them "out of respect; if
                            young, hoping to do them good; if from a distance, because they had come
                            from far; if from near home, because neighbours would be naturally
                            aggrieved at being excluded when she was open to receiving
                            strangers."</p>
<p class="">As
                        her strength for earthly journeyings declined, her thoughts centred more and
                        more on the "land of far distances," and she
                        realised fully that the time of her departure was at hand. Her final illness
                        lasted for eleven months&mdash;long enough for a whole treasury of dying sayings;
                        but the "gayety" of which she spoke in her seventy-first year never forsook
                        her, and is not one of the least charming traits in the character of this
                        quiet reformer.</p>
<p class="">
                        On the
                            7th of September the end came, and after lying in a
                        semi-delirious state for many hours, she passed away, murmuring as her last
                        conscious words, "Patty&mdash;joy."
                        There is a deep pathos in the association of the words. One could almost
                        believe that a glimpse of that beloved sister who had shared in so much of
                        her earthly happiness was vouchsafed to her, waiting perhaps to welcome her
                        within the golden gates of that beautiful country wherein is "fulness of joy, and
                            pleasures for evermore."</p>
<p class="">On the
                            13th of September 1833, every church in Bristol rang a muffled peal, and the
                        tired body of Hannah More was laid to rest in Wrington churchyard, amid every
                        manifestation of respectful mourning. There lie the five More sisters, of
                        whom Johnson had said, "I love you all!"&hellip;</p>
<p class="">Judged by the
                        present pyrotechnic style of literary composition, the success of her work
                        seems phenomenal; but in her day books were not so much a matter of daily
                        outputting as now, and for a publisher to be delivered into the hands of a
                        woman was a welcome novelty. Phrases, too, which to us seem "stilted" almost
                        to absurdity, were then only the courtesies of everyday life&mdash;so much is the
                        standard of politeness in its decadence. But it is not
                        too much to say that Hannah More will always be remembered with respectful
                        admiration, even by men of more literary culture than William
                            Wilberforce, who said that he would "rather appear in
                            Heaven as the author of <em>The Shepherd of Salisbury
                                Plain</em> than as the author of <em>Peveril of the
                                Peak</em>."
                        Such
                        men as the shepherd doubtless still exist, though their conditions may be
                        different; and among the many new editions that are continually cropping up,
                        perhaps "Coelebs" and "Will Chip" may yet appear with their wholesome
                        influences, to the displacement of some of our modern writers and the
                        benefit of the next generation.</p>
<p class="">Her large-heartedness is conspicuously evidenced in her life-long friendship
                        with Mrs Garrick&mdash;n&eacute;e Eva Veigel&mdash;"La Violetta" of the Viennese ballet.
                            The fact of
                        a staunch Evangelical and a loyal Romanist being able to spend twenty
                        winters together on terms of closest intimacy speaks for itself, though it
                        is quite likely that in these days when the Italian Mission is becoming more
                        and more realised as a proselytising agency, such an unfettered intercourse
                        would be almost impossible, or at any rate impracticable. Hannah More says
                        candidly, "We dispute
                            like a couple of Jesuits"; but it is clear that the love on either
                        side was in no way affected, nor the possibility of compromise
                        entertained.</p>
<p class="">
<em>Of More's character as exhibited by her handwriting,
                            Green-Armytage concludes:</em> The versatility which shows itself in
                        Hannah More's handwriting is manifested by the readiness with which she
                        devoted the ambitions, which had been fostered under Garrick's
                        guidance, to other interests; and what dramatic powers she possessed were
                        quickly overshadowed by the characteristic enthusiasm with which she threw
                        herself into religious and philanthropic reforms. This divine enthusiasm, however,
                        never waned, as her last book on <span class="subtitle "><em>The Spirit of
                                Prayer</em></span> clearly shows. It proclaims, in tones as
                        distinct, though less forcible, Carlyle's solemn message to the
                            world&mdash;"No
                            prayer, no religion, or at least only a dumb and lamed one! Prayer is
                            and remains always a native and deepest impulse of the soul of man; and,
                            correctly gone about, is of the very highest benefit (nay, one might say
                            indispensability) to every man aiming morally high in this world. Prayer
                            is a turning of one's soul in heroic reverence, in infinite desire and
                            endeavour, towards the Highest, the All Excellent, Omnipotent,
                            Supreme."</p>
<p class="">"Hannah More is
                            incapable of a literary resurrection," says the Minister of
                        Education.... It may be so, but when the struggle of 1906
                        is only remembered as one more illustration of the extraordinary bias which
                        early training can give to the mind of a man learned in the Law and the
                        Scriptures, the Church shall be quietly extending her boundaries throughout
                        the world, and educating generations of children whose Imperial instincts
                        shall march side by side with the principles and practices for which Hannah
                        More pleaded more than a hundred years ago.</p>

<em>A. J. Green-Armytage&rsquo;s
                            biography of Hannah More takes a sympathetic and admiring view of More&rsquo;s
                            religiosity and literary merits, while at the same time keeping with a
                            largely traditional view of the role of the independent woman.
                            Additionally, Green-Armytage appears to have a personal quarrel with the
                            criticism leveled by Augustine Birrell on Hannah More&rsquo;s
                            writing; Green-Armytage regards More as having a much higher degree of
                            literary talent than does Birrell.</em>
