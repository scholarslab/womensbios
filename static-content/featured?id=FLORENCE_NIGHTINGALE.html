<p class="" id="N13CCA_p">While biography is devoted to relating the lives of actual individuals (in
                        other words, it is non-fiction), it is a narrative form that, like history,
                        draws on conventions often used in the novel. The lived experience is
                        condensed into a series of episodes; the descriptions are glowing, the
                        incidents are momentous, the exceptional person is rendered in stimulating
                        narratives. In biographies compiled during the Victorian era, female
                        subjects become the heroines of their own stories; yet, when we look at the
                        similarity in treatment used by many of the presenters, these personal
                        stories overlap to create a narrative for the nineteenth-century woman of
                        action. Since about 1980, studies of the Victorian period have rediscovered
                        the many ways that Florence
                            Nightingale was represented as a paragon of female vocation and
                        service. Contemporary biographies provide a measure of this remarkably
                        collaborative process of representation, as if making a classic legend out
                        of a living contemporary. After all, Nightingale outlived <a href="featured%3Fid=QUEEN_VICTORIA.html">Queen Victoria</a>; in November, 1910, when

                        policy, had only been dead a few months.</p>
<p class="">Nightingale, a heroine of
                        nursing during the Crimean War and a hospital reformer, was an extremely
                        popular subject of prosopographies written prior to 1930, outnumbered in
                        appearances only by <a href="featured%3Fid=JOAN_OF_ARC.html">Joan of Arc</a> and
                        philanthropist <a href="featured%3Fid=ELIZABETH_FRY.html">Elizabeth Fry</a>, according
                        to our samples in the Pop Chart. Comparing presentations of Nightingale&rsquo;s
                        life in different works reveals nineteenth-century biography as a form of
                        pastiche. Various writers compose her story in episodes that are lifted
                        verbatim or nearly-verbatim from other sources. As these narratives are
                        repeated consistently throughout biographies, they become naturalized in the
                        popular imagination and together contribute to figuring her as the &ldquo;Lady with
                            the Lamp&rdquo;&mdash;an archetypal image for the ministering woman which
                        presenters also used in depictions of Elizabeth Fry&rsquo;s life. In these
                        prosopographies, we can rediscover one of the ways that Nightingale's
                        persona was transmitted as an example for later generations, not least for
                        skeptical interpreters of the Victorian age from Lytton
                            Strachey to Mary Poovey.</p>
<p class="">Here, excerpts from two biographies&mdash;Hamilton Wright Mabie and Kate Stephens's
                            <em>Heroines That Every Child Should Know</em> and Rosa
                        Carey's <em>Twelve Notable Good Women</em>&mdash;are condensed into
                        episodes and placed side-by-side for comparative analysis. Passages which
                        are repeated word-for-word in each have been highlighted. By drawing the
                        biographical pastiche to the surface of the presentations, we are able to
                        discern some consistent narrative techniques of the genre. While noticing
                        the similarities, we also become more attuned to pointed variations in the
                        "story" of Nightingale's life, in which case, a critical evaluation is
                        included in the introduction to the episode.</p>

</div>Nightingale's promise as a
                            nurse revealed itself at an early age. The guidance of a sage "old
                            friend" (a local minister who became her mentor) supplemented an innate
                            sympathetic interest in the well-being of others and led Nightingale to
                            her first medical achievement: healing a dog's badly wounded leg. Mabie
                            and Stephens render the episode in great detail, creating a vivid scene
                            of narration in contrast with Carey's cursory treatment. Nonetheless,
                            both presenters make note of the episode to situate Nightingale within
                            her little community, identifying a collective recognition of her early
                            talent and a dependence thereafter upon her expertise for nursing its
                            everyday ailments: </span>

<span class="subtitle author">Mabie &amp; Stephens</span>
                    
</p>
<p class="block">There lived in one of two or three solitary cottages in the wood
                        an old shepherd of her father's, named Roger, who had a favourite sheep-dog
                        called Cap. Roger had neither wife nor child, and Cap lived with him and
                        kept him company. . . . Cap was a very sensible dog; indeed people used to
                        say he could do everything but speak. He kept the sheep in wonderfully good
                        order. . . . One day as Florence and her old friend were out for a ride,
                        they came to a field where they found the shepherd giving his sheep their
                        night feed; but he was without the dog, and the sheep knew it, for they were
                        scampering in every direction. . . . They stopped to ask what was the
                        matter, and what had become of his dog.</p>
<p class="block">"Oh," said Roger, "Cap will never be of any more use to
                        me; I'll have to hang him, poor fellow, as soon as I go home to-night. . . ,
                        one of the mischievous school boys throwed a stone at him yesterday and
                        broke one of his legs." And the old shepherd's eyes filled with tears, which
                        he wiped away with his shirt-sleeve, then he drove his spade deep in the
                        ground to hide what he felt, for he did not like to be seen crying.</p>
<p class="block">There on the bare brick floor lay the dog, his hair dishevelled,
                        and his eyes sparkling with anger at the intruders. When he looked at
                        Florence and heard her call him "poor Cap," he began to wag his short tail;
                        and then crept from under the table and lay down at her feet. She took hold
                        of one of his paws, patted his old rough head, and talked to him, whilst her
                        friend examined the injured leg. It was dreadfully swollen, and hurt very
                        much to have it examined; but the dog knew it was meant kindly, . . . . </p>
<p class="block">"It's only a bad bruise, no bones are broken," said her old
                        friend. "Rest is all Cap needs; he will soon be well again."</p>
<p class="block">"I am so glad," said Florence; "but can we do nothing for him,
                        he seems in such pain?"</p>
<p class="block">"There is one thing that would ease the pain and heal the leg
                        all the sooner, and that is plenty of hot water to foment the part."</p>
<p class="block">Florence struck a light with the tinder-box, and lighted the
                        fire, which was already laid. She then set off to the other cottage to get
                        something to bathe the leg with. She found an old flannel petticoat hanging
                        up to dry, and this she carried off, and tore up into strips, which she
                        wrung out in warm water, and laid them tenderly on Cap's swollen leg. It was
                        not long before the poor dog felt the benefit of the application, and he
                        looked grateful, wagging his little stump of a tail in thanks. . . On the
                        next morning Florence was up early, and the first thing she did was to take
                        two flannel petticoats to give to the poor woman whose skirt she had torn up
                        to bathe Cap. Then she went to the dog, and was delighted to find the
                        swelling of his leg much less. . . . </p>
<p class="block">Two or three days afterward Florence and her friend were riding
                        together, when they came up to Roger and his sheep. This time Cap was
                        watching the sheep, . . . . When he heard the voice of Florence speaking to
                        his master, who was portioning out the usual food, his tail wagged and his
                        eyes sparkled, but he did not get up, for he was on duty. The shepherd
                        stopped his work, and as he glanced at the dog with a merry laugh, said, "Do
                        look at the dog, Miss; he be so pleased to hear your voice." Cap's tail went
                        faster and faster. "I be glad," continued the old man, "I did not hang him.
                        . . ."</p>
<p class="block">But from the day the little girl nursed the leg of the
                        shepherd's dog, it became the custom of the neighbourhood where she lived to
                        send for her when anyone had a cut or bruise or sick animal.</p>

<p class="block">Florence Nightingale was particularly fond of animals, and it is
                        interesting to hear that her first attempt at nursing was performed on an
                        old Scotch shepherd's dog with an injured leg. From that day, we are told,
                        "that it became a custom when any one had a cut or bruise, or a sick animal,
                        to send for Miss Florence."</p>

                            Nightingale and her first "patient," the subsequent impact of the
                            episode on her choice of vocation is treated almost verbatim in the
                            texts. The presenters rely on the same sources to discuss Nightingale's
                            education and both include a reference to her sober tastes in reading as
                            a testament to her dedication. <a href="featured%3Fid=FLORENCE_NIGHTINGALE.html#FLORENCE_NIGHTINGALE_NOTE_1" class="note-link">[1]</a> The young nurse's reading habits were self-edifying and led her to

                            which is notable: Mabie and Stephens direct our attention to the object
                            of a "great work," while Carey's addition, "when the call came it found
                            her ready," redirects that focus to the personal capabilities of her
                            subject. As the latter forecasts Nightingale's heroism in the service of
                            her countrymen, she also alludes to the potential for female energy in
                            the field of action:</span>

                                almoner to the cottages around her home, and nursed all illnesses
                                under the advice of her mother and the vicar."</a></span>
                         Her favourite books were those that taught of helpfulness to the
                        suffering and miserable, and it seemed as if her whole nature was turning
                        toward her great work. While still a young girl she became interested in
                        what <a href="featured%3Fid=ELIZABETH_FRY.html">Elizabeth Fry</a> had done in English
                        prisons, and she paid an interested visit to Mrs. Fry.</p>
<p class="block">When in London she would visit hospitals and kindred
                        institutions, and it is said that in the family travels in Egypt she nursed
                        to health several sick Arabs. Her tastes and time, it is evident, were
                        turned toward a humane and benevolent rather than a social life. . . She had
                        withdrawn from gaieties to learn whatever she could of the hospitals of
                        London, Edinburgh and Dublin, and indeed, of the civil and military
                        hospitals of all Europe, and finally in 1851, she went into training as a
                        nurse in a famous institution at Kaiserwerth on the Rhine. Here, when she
                        had taken the course of instruction, she passed a distinguished
                        examination.</p>
<p class="block">But at this time a hospital and home in London for sick and aged
                        governesses was about to fail from lack of means and lack of able direction.
                        To this Miss Nightingale gave herself with ardour, and so renewed its
                        strength that it still remains a witness to her energy. She gave largely to
                        this institution. Nevertheless she was to be found, says a visitor, "organising the nurses,
                            attending to the correspondence, prescriptions and accounts; in short,
                            performing all the duties of a hard-working matron."</p>
<p class="block">Ten years she had been serving apprenticeship for the great work

                            youth, had studied medicine. Her favourite books were those that dealt
                            with the alleviation of human suffering and misery, and it seemed as
                            though her whole nature were impelled in that direction. She became,
                            while still a young girl, interested in the prison work of <a href="featured%3Fid=ELIZABETH_FRY.html">Elizabeth Fry</a>, and paid a memorable
                            visit to that veteran friend of humanity in her London home."</p>
<p class="block">The ordinary routine of London social life had few attractions
                        for Florence Nightingale. We hear that she and her sister were presented,
                        but very shortly afterwards she withdrew from all gaieties.
                        The call, "Come up higher," had
                            already sounded in her ears. During the next few years she gave her
                        attention to the condition of hospitals. After a systematic inspection of
                        those in London, Dublin, and Edinburgh, she visited civil and military
                        hospitals all over Europe, and in 1851 went into training as a nurse in the
                        Institution of Protestant Deaconesses, at Kaiserswerth on the Rhine. . .
                        After a period of much needed rest at Lea Hurst, Miss Nightingale undertook
                        the management of an institution for sick and aged governesses at 47 Harley
                        Street, and devoted herself, with energy and ardour, to the reorganisation
                        of this institution, which remains to-day as a monument of her work and
                        method. A lady who visited her in Harley Street said, "She was to be found in
                            the midst of the various duties of a hospital, for the Home was largely
                            a Sanatorium, organising the nurses, attending to the correspondence,
                            prescriptions and accounts; in short, performing all the duties of a
                            hard-working matron, as well as largely financing the
                        institution."</p>
<p class="block">For ten years she had served her apprenticeship in preparation
                        for the work of her life; when the call came it found her ready. She was
                        then about thirty-four. </p>

<span class="subtitle section">The Crimean War was Nightingale's most famous field
                            of action and her work as a professional nurse during this period made
                            her a public sensation. As the war raged on through the winter of
                            1854-1855, fighting on the battlefield as well as inadequate medical
                            support threatened heavy casualties among England's soldiers. Mabie and
                            Stephens as well as Carey repeat the same anecdote of a prophetic
                            coincidence as evidence of Nightingale's readiness to commit herself to
                            service even before "the call came" in a letter from the head of the War
                            Department. Nightingale led a company of nurses to Turkey and Mabie and
                            Stephens emphasize that a vocation for England's ministering women at
                            the front-lines of a war effort was unprecedented:</span>

<p class="block">In 1854 a war broke out between England and Russia. It is known
                        as the Crimean War. England sent her soldiers to the Black Sea in many
                        thousands. These soldiers were sadly clad and fed. Bad management seems to
                        have prevailed, and the service for carrying supplies was inadequate. Warm
                        clothing, blankets, tents and other protection failed to reach the
                        troops.</p>
<p class="block">During that winter of 1854, many were frozen in their tents. Of
                        nearly forty-five thousand, over eighteen thousand were reported in the
                        hospitals. The English people at last saw their disaster, and certain women
                        volunteered services of helpfulness. The head of the War Department of the
                        Government who knew of Miss Nightingale's interest in nursing, asked her to
                        superintend and organise a staff of nurses. By a strange coincidence Florence Nightingale had written
                            and offered her aid to the sick and wounded soldiers, and her letter
                            passed the letter from the Government.</p>
<p class="block">It was an undertaking wholly new to English habits&mdash;a band of
                        devoted women going to soften the horrors of war and save lives the war had
                        endeavoured to end. . . They sailed across the Mediterranean and in
                        November, 1854, reached Scutari, a town in Turkey in Asia, opposite
                        Constantinople. </p>

<p class="block">"When war broke out between England and Russia, in March
                            1854, the hospital arrangements of the British army were in a very
                            imperfect state. The army while at Varna suffered from a deficient
                            number of surgeons, though many courageous volunteers offered
                            themselves. A hospital was established at Scutari, a port of the Turkish
                            capital, and was intended for the wounded soldiers. . . But it was at
                            Scutari that the great evils were prevalent, the great horrors enacted,
                            and the indelible shame upon our country inflicted." There is no
                        sadder chapter of human history than that of the Crimean War, and yet the
                        causes of all these miseries have never been adequately traced. The grossest
                        mismanagement seemed to have prevailed; the transport service was
                        inadequate; the stores of warm clothing, great-coats, blankets and huts,
                        which had been ordered for the protection of the army in winter, failed to
                        reach them for weeks after the English newspapers told of the comforts
                        provided for the troops.</p>
<p class="block">Such was the state of things at the close of 1854, and to some
                        extent during the remainder of the winter. But help was at hand. The head of
                        the War Department was Mr. Sidney Herbert, afterwards Lord Herbert of Lea.
                        He was an enlightened and far-sighted man; he knew of Miss Nightingale's
                        interest in nursing, and he wrote to her. Some ladies had already
                        volunteered their services, and a staff of female nurses was being formed,
                        and he asked her to undertake the superintendence of the lady nurses and to
                        organise the operations. By
                            a strange coincidence, the very day Mr. Sidney Herbert wrote his
                            memorable letter, Florence Nightingale had actually written to him
                            offering her services to the sick and wounded in the Hospital at
                            Scutari. The letters had crossed. Great must have been her surprise
                        when she read his, asking her to take command of the little nursing band,
                        and leave for the East in eight days. Short was the notice, nevertheless
                        Miss Nightingale had everything ready; and on October 21st, 1854, and
                        accompanied by her friends, Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge, of Atherstane Hall,
                        Yorkshire, and a band of thirty-eight nurses, she left England on her great
                        mission. </p>

<span class="subtitle section">When Nightingale's band of nurses reached Scutari in
                            Turkey, they found a 'battlefield' of their own in the hospital there,
                            which claimed victims through deplorable sanitation conditions. In the
                            excerpts of this episode, the presenters have a similar tone, using an
                            imperative inflection to relate the circumstances the nurses encountered
                            in the context of an ordeal. The narrative technique also reflects the
                            urgency of the transformation which Nightingale orchestrates&mdash;the
                            legend-making at work in nineteenth-century biography is exemplified in
                            Carey's use of hyperbolic language and allusion to Herculean
                            myth.</span>

</div>The systems of
                            management Nightingale implemented in Scutari's hospital are akin to
                            Victorian housekeeping practices: her nurses cleaned, cooked and
                            regulated the patients' dietary needs, organized and distributed
                            supplies; as well, the passage from Mabie and Stephens contains a
                            reference to the gendered labor of sewing and washing. Nightingale
                            engaged the methods of household management on a level of national
                            importance as she instituted reforms which also advanced England's war
                            effort. Quoted verbatim in each biography is a note on the opposition
                            the "gentle missionaries" met with from male officials who considered
                            them to be "anarchists." However, the presenters include this compelling
                            detail in passing&mdash;neither pursues the underlying implications of
                            Nightingale's challenge to the military establishment and masculine
                            authority. Her campaign for professionalized nursing during the Crimean
                            War involved an obvious conflation of spheres and revealed a porousness
                            in the supposed barrier to female agency in a public field of action:

<p class="block"> Four thousand sick and wounded soldiers lay in the hospitals
                        awaiting their ministrations. And still others from a great battle were
                        coming in. These hospitals were so filled that even in the corridors were
                        two rows of mattresses and so close together that two persons could barely
                        walk between the rows. The beds reeked with infection. There was no thought,
                        seemingly, of sanitation. Rather than curers the hospitals were breeders of
                        pestilence.</p>
<p class="block">"The
                            whole of yesterday one could only forget one's own existence," wrote one
                            of the nurses, "for it was spent first in sewing the men's mattresses,
                            and then in washing them, and assisting the surgeons, when we could, in
                            dressing their ghastly wounds after their five days' confinement on
                            board ship, during which space hundreds of wounds had not been dressed.
                            Hundreds of men with fever, dysentery and cholera (the wounded were the
                            smaller portion) filled the wards in succession from the overcrowded
                            transports." Such were the conditions this band of women found.</p>
<p class="block">The head of the band, Miss Nightingale, began her work of
                        organization. She laboured with tireless energy and indomitable will. But
                        not without opposition. The military and medical officials, says one who was
                        there,

<p class="block">They reached Scutari on November 5th, in time to receive the
                        wounded from the Battle of Inkermann. On their arrival they set at once to
                        the performance of their arduous duties. Indescribably horrible was the
                        state of the hospital when Miss Nightingale made her first inspection.
                        Sanitary arrangements were nil. The beds were reeking with infection.
                        Outside the hospital was a hotbed of pestilence. Hercules' labour in
                        clearing the Augean stables could only be compared to the awful task that
                        lay before those devoted women. A tower at one of the corners of the Barrack
                        Hospital gave them accommodation.</p>
<p class="block">From the first the indomitable will of "the Lady-in-chief," as
                        she was called, made itself felt in every department, which gradually broke
                        down all obstacles raised by the jealousy or bad tempers of the officials.
                        As Nolan tells us, "Doctors, purveyors, store-keepers,
                            orderlies, inspectors, dispensers, and interpreters <span class="corresp" id="nightingale.carey.2"><a href="featured%3Fid=FLORENCE_NIGHTINGALE.html#nightingale.mabie.2">were in the
                                uttermost confusion amongst themselves, and they generally regarded
                                these gentle missionaries as a new element of
                            anarchy."</a></span> <a href="featured%3Fid=FLORENCE_NIGHTINGALE.html#FLORENCE_NIGHTINGALE_NOTE_2" class="note-link">[2]</a>
</p>
<p class="block">As Kinglake says most beautifully: "It was not
                            only under her reign, but by force of her actual sway, that order sprang
                            out of chaos; that the hell she had found when she came knew at last the
                            blessing of cleanliness; that the administration of our Levantine
                            hospitals began to seem almost perfect. . . . She brought to her
                            self-imposed task that forethought, that agile brain-power, that
                            organising and governing faculty of which our country had
                            need." <a href="featured%3Fid=FLORENCE_NIGHTINGALE.html#FLORENCE_NIGHTINGALE_NOTE_3" class="note-link">[3]</a>
</p>
<p class="block">A further staff of fifty trained female nurses had been sent
                        from England to help Miss Nightingale and assistants. There was plenty of
                        work for all. One can only imagine what privations and discomforts those
                        devoted women had to undergo during those months of wearing fatigue and
                        endurance, and it would be difficult to give any idea of their round of
                        daily and nightly duties. They had to do everything for themselves as well
                        as for the patients. </p>

<span class="subtitle section">A rhetorical convention of
                            prosopography apparent in sketches of Nightingale's life is the topos
                            scene of a ministering angel nursing a dying man. Mabie and Stephens as
                            well as Carey duplicate a description of Nightingale performing her duty
                            at the side of a wounded soldier lying on the surgeon's table, about to
                            undergo the horrors of an amputation. Implied in the image is the mutual
                            ordeal she prepares to face, "patiently standing by him and, with lips
                            closely set and hands folded, decreeing herself to go through the pain
                            of witnessing pain." The narrative episode becomes a testament to
                            Nightingale's mettle. Taking a meta-critical perspective on the generic
                            conventions of collective biographies of women, we can see that the
                            topos repeated in the following passages suggests that the ministering
                            angel possesses a fortitude which is peculiar to females. At the same
                            time, this portrayal of a woman reflects (so as to reinforce) a man's
                            strength to endure painful trials:</span>

<p class="block">Every fresh detachment of the wounded meant fresh work for the
                        band of devoted women. Miss Nightingale was always among the busiest and she
                        was known to stand for twenty hours assisting at operations, directing
                        nurses, herself ministering to cholera and fever patients and distributing

<p class="block">There are some interesting passages in Nolan's
                        "History" which give us an idea of the work of this
                        wonderful woman, collected from the letters of Mr. Osborne, Mr. Bracebridge,
                        Mr. Macdonald, and her faithful and zealous young helper,"Mr.
                            Stafford, who sat by the bedside of the patients, reading for them the
                            letters of their friends, and acting as letter-writer-general on their
                            behalf."
                        "She, Miss
                            Nightingale, had to tend, or see tended, thousands of sick men."
                        And again: "I was
                            with her when various surgical operations were performed, and she was
                            more than equal to the trial. She has an utter disregard to contagion. I
                            have known her spend hours over men dying of cholera or fever."</p>
<p class="block">When Mr. Macdonald was about to return to England he wrote
                        concerning this queen of nurses: "Wherever there is disease in its most
                        dangerous form, and the hand of the spoiler distressingly nigh, there is
                        this incomparable woman sure to be seen. Her benignant presence is an
                        influence for good comfort even amid the struggles of expiring nature."</p>
<p class="block">When fresh detachments of the wounded were brought in, she had
                        been known to stand for twenty hours, distributing stores, directing nurses,
                        assisting at operations, and ministering to cholera and fever patients.</p>
<p class="block">No worker in this world's history has been free from
                        detractions, but one can hardly credit that there were tongues to find fault
                        with this brave woman; but no such censure was passed by those amongst whom
                        she worked. Kinglake tells us:

</div>Another topos element that presenters
                            repeat to demonstrate Nightingale's heroic dedication is a description
                            of her making rounds among the wounded soldiers under her care at
                            Scutari. As a practice, she walked the hospital corridors late into the
                            night, lighting the way with a lamp that also signaled her reassuring
                            presence to the many suffering patients. Mabie and Stephens as well as
                            Carey rely upon the same source material for an account of Nightingale's
                            nocturnal habit, reproducing the episode as a topos event which
                            represents her mission of service. This topos (scene of interaction) of
                            mission, duplicated across several sketches of her life's work, also
                            entails a trope (figure of speech or image): the mission brings light
                            into darkness, as a metaphor for bringing hope or relief to the
                            suffering as well as civilization or order to settings of violence or
                            disorder. Curiously, in Nightingale's iconography, she herself brings
                            light but also shadow, an intangible image that the men each may kiss.
                            The socially-constructed rhetoric of female vocation as the bearing of a
                            beacon mythologized Victorian women's public service, serving at the
                            same time to reinforce an individual woman's status above a certain
                            class of men (often conscripted men) as well as her difference from
                            other women. Often the beacon or light-into-darkness imagery is
                            associated with the trope that we call "alone," the idea that the
                            heroine braves the darkness in solitude or without protection, whether
                            or not she was accompanied by assistants or male peers or authorities
                            who ensure her safety or success. We find the light-into-darkness trope
                            in multiple biographies about one subject also being applied to link
                            several subjects within one collective biography. In fact, this trope
                            appears across many genres in the nineteenth-century, contributing to
                            the fullness of a narrative pastiche which transforms living women into
                            cultural lengend. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow reiterates the rhetoric in
                            verse form to present Nightingale as a luminous subject&mdash;excerpts of the
                            poem he wrote for her appear in Mabie and Stephens as well as Carey:

<p class="">
                        
<span class="subtitle section">Like the presenters of prosopography, Longfellow's use
                            of the light-into-darkness trope contributes to defining the ideal form
                            of "womanhood," which was not the listless and marginalized figure later
                            critics have associated with Victorian femininity. Longfellow depicts
                            Nightingale as both ethereal and steadfast; the comforting beacon in a
                            desolate house as well as a pillar of social good; a ministering angel
                            diffusing her energy in service to others even as she reifies her
                            legendary self.</span>

<span class="subtitle section">In response to popular interest in the "Lady with the
                            Lamp," the Crimean war correspondent for the London <em>Times</em> recorded an account of Nightingale's nursing habits,
                            which Mabie and Stephens as well as Carey reproduce: "When all the
                            medical officers have retired for the night and silence and darkness has
                            settled down on the miles of prostrate sick, she may be observed
                                alone with a little lamp in her hand making her
                            solitary rounds." In a pastiche between journalism and biography, each
                            presenter appropriates the eye-witness news report for his own narrative

<span class="subtitle section">Mabie and Stephens as well as Carey provide
                            nearly identical presentations of the topos of Nightingale's physical
                            persona and other's response to it; the passages repeat some material
                            verbatim. The excerpts suggest that her feminine, upper-class appearance
                            belied a mental sharpness and capacity for administrative leadership
                            which, while generally associated with masculinity in the Victorian era,
                            was claimed for women and celebrated in female collective biographies
                            written during the nineteenth-century. Nightingale's aspect of fragility
                            cancelled out the stereotype of the muscular, vulgar nurse that had
                            previously prevailed. Her perceived youth, elegance, and refinement
                            contributed to her legend as a heroic figure, making her disregard of
                            contagion and dedication to long hours at the bedsides of patients seem
                            physically impossible. These presenters link her surprising endurance to
                            a definition of true womanhood and suggest that femininity is not the
                            absence of fortitude but the channeling of it both to provide comfort
                            and to encourage wounded soldiers who no longer have physical strength
                            of their own.</span>

<span class="subtitle section">In 1855, while inspecting war hospitals, Nightingale
                            contracted Crimean fever and was near death for twelve days. She
                            recovered, but the illness, along with over-exertion, compromised her
                            health. On returning to England in 1856 after the war's end, she spent
                            much of the rest of her life as an invalid and became an adept woman of
                            letters, statistician, and government advisor. Although she physically
                            was unable to continue her nursing work, she still had a public presence
                            in the medical field, writing reports, dictating official correspondence
                            and advising on health care reforms from her bed. The legend of the
                            ministering angel of the Crimean War, based on her image as a beautiful,
                            delicate lady, gave her the stature to influence the policies of both
                            domestic and foreign governments:</span>

<span class="subtitle section">When the Crimean War ended, Florence Nightingale
                            was already a living legend in the public's imagination and a grateful
                            nation was eager to pay tribute to its heroine. Like many of the other
                            eminent women celebrated in nineteenth-century collective biographies,
                            she received recognition for her service from Queen Victoria. Interest
                            in her exploits during the war had inspired even the Queen to ply her
                            needle for the nursing effort, and as Carey&rsquo;s presentation indicates,
                            Nightingale understood that the story of her "great and remarkable
                            experience in the East" could serve as a tool to galvanize her continued
                            mission of reform. Mabie and Stephens as well as Carey include testimony
                            of her modesty about public recognition, a characteristic which goes
                            hand-in-hand with Victorian ideals for feminine behavior. Yet
                            Nightingale was certainly not reserved about the insight she gained from
                            her experience with England&rsquo;s Army Medical Service and the legends from
                            Scutari gave her a captive audience for her mission to improve medical
                            care on the home front. She capitalized upon popular recognition to
                            ensure political recognition and maintain support for her campaign. As
                            one of Nightingale&rsquo;s biographers recently noted, "no Victorian, except
                            perhaps the queen, made more effective use of attrition by letter! Not
                            for her were the waiting in the corridors of power and the attending of
                            committees; people came to her and by appointment" (ODNB):</span>

<p class="block">At last the fighting was brought to an end. For a year and a
                        half had the noble and humane work of nursing gone on and shown the world
                        how much greater is the saving of lives than the destruction of lives by the
                        murder of war. The gratitude the English people felt for what the nurses had
                        done they expressed by a gift of fifty thousand pounds to Miss Nightingale
                        after her return to England. They had planned also a public welcome of their
                        heroine, but with the modesty and calm judgment that always characterised
                        her, she slipped quietly into England by the carriage of a French steamer
                        and so to her country home. <a href="featured%3Fid=QUEEN_VICTORIA.html">Queen
                            Victoria,</a> who with her husband the Prince Consort, had most
                        earnestly admired Miss Nightingale's course, and had sought direct knowledge
                        of her work during her stay in the East, entertained her at Balmoral and
                        presented her with a valuable jewel. The sum presented her by the nation
                        was, at her request, given to the foundation of a training home for nurses
                        in connection with St. Thomas's Hospital. It is called the "Nightingale
                        Home." </p>

<p class="block">
                        "All England," as
                                Mrs. Tooley tells us in her article, "from <a href="featured%3Fid=QUEEN_VICTORIA.html">the Queen</a> to the humblest peasant,
                            were making warm garments and preparing lint and bandages for the
                            soldiers. The Patriotic Fund for the relief of the widows and orphans
                            rose by leaps and bounds, until within a year it amounted to one million
                            pounds."
                    </p>
<p class="block">The Queen had already sent Miss Nightingale an auto-graph
                        letter, with a jewelled Cross of St. George, inscribed in letters of gold
                        with the words, "Blessed are the Merciful," and on her return she was
                        summoned to Balmoral. On September 21st she was introduced to the Queen and
                        the Prince Consort by Sir James Clark, with whom she was then staying at
                        Birkhall. "She
                            put before us," is the brief entry in the Prince's diary, "all the
                            defects of our present military hospital system, and the reforms that
                            are needed. We are much pleased with her. She is extremely
                        modest."</p>
<p class="block">About a fortnight later, we are told, Miss Nightingale became
                        the Queen's guest, "the time of her visit being so fixed as to give Lord
                        Panmure, who was then at Balmoral, an opportunity of learning from her own
                        lips the story of what she had seen and the conclusions she had drawn from
                        her great and remarkable experience in the East."</p>
<p class="block">Florence Nightingale had evaded a public ovation on her return
                        from Scutari, but the magnificent testimonial of fifty thousand pounds was
                        presented by the nation and army, in recognition of her splendid services;
                        but by her request this sum was devoted to the formation of a Training Home
                        for Nurses in connection with St. Thomas's Hospital. It is called "The
                        Nightingale Home," and has a reputation worthy of its founder. </p>
<p class="">
                        
<span class="subtitle section">Nightingale was a pioneer for female participation in
                            the public professions and argued for the social benefit of giving
                            educated women paid work as nurses and midwives. She challenged male
                            medical authorities and governmental policy makers, pushing for reform
                            in England&rsquo;s health system and sanitation in India. As well, she
                            insisted upon society&rsquo;s responsibility to care for the poor, and in her
                            hospital reports demonstrated that mortality rates could be
                            significantly reduced through the practices of the newly emerging
                            sanitary sciences. The &ldquo;Nightingale Home&rdquo; became the first training
                            school for nurses and aimed to standardize practices of caring for
                            patients in hospitals. Along with her colleague and Victorian
                            contemporary Charles Dickens and in league with
                                Angela Burdett-Coutts (another subject in collective
                            biographies of women in the period), Nightingale used her popularity to
                            spear-head public service projects in support of London&rsquo;s poor and
                            infirm. Her life spanned the Victorian era and her career had a lasting
                            influence on the progress of medical services in the military as well as

<span class="subtitle section">In his widely-read collective biography, <em>Eminent Victorians</em>, Lytton Strachey
                            asserted that the real Florence Nightingale was "more interesting than
                            the legendary one though less agreeable" (qtd. in ODNB). At the same
                            time however, the legendary "Lady with the Lamp"&mdash;or as Mabie and
                            Stephens coin her, the "Angel of the Crimea"&mdash;provided the real Florence
                            Nightingale with a position of public prominence unusual for women in
                            most eras of history, what she referred to as having an "office." The
                            popular narratives of her heroism that form the pastiche of biographical
                            tributes from the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century assisted the
                            determined nurse as she undertook the colossal task of reforming
                            England&rsquo;s inadequate hospital system. Florence Nightingale became a
                            trusted advisor for the health of the nation just as the "Lady with the
                            Lamp" was the trusted bearer of hope through the darkened halls of
                            misery in Scutari.</span>
