                            recognition. Writing in the early twentieth century (1908), Daffan
                        subscribes to a belief in genius, and begins with high praise for it:</p>
<p class="block">Genius is a combination of native strength and will power. A
                        "genius" is sure to accomplish something, his presence will be felt, and his
                        influence exerted....through years and years which follow his brief
                        existence.</p>
<p class="block">I do not share the opinion of some that the world is full of
                        "unrecognized genius".... When a genius has "common" sense along with his
                        other powers and attributes, he commands recognition from the world at the
                        time in which he lives, and admiration from his biographers. This
                        combination is invincible and brings in its train acuteness, observation,
                        and impressiveness.</p>
<p class="">Daffan recounts the birth of
                        "Madame Anna L. de Sta&euml;l" in Paris, April 22, 1766: "In the inquiring, infidel, though certainly brilliant
                            age, the eve of the French revolution, there appeared a
                        genius...recognized then as now.... Up to the time of Madame de Sta&euml;l
                        letter-writing was the only literary accomplishment attained by women, but
                        to such a degree was it attained, as specimens still extant show, that it
                        was considered a very decided literary accomplishment." </p>
<p class="block">She was the first woman to make a
                            place for herself in the literary world; she stood far ahead of any
                            woman of her time. By her pen, which was always brilliant, though
                        sometimes sarcastic, she pleaded for that which was true and permanent, and
                        condemned the false and unstable. Her charm, manner, and wonderful power in
                        conversation brought to her side many who were first admirers and later
                        sympathizers. </p>
<p class="block">As a rule conversation as an accomplishment or an art develops
                        in middle life, after the mind is enriched by reading and travel and
                        broadened by experience; but to this pretty general rule Madame de Sta&euml;l was
                        an exception; as a young girl, even
                            as a child, her conversation was remarkable for command of words and
                            beautiful sentiment.
                    </p>
<p class="block">Napoleon Bonaparte paid
                        few compliments; ...he usually demanded that they be paid to him. But the
                        highest compliment a man ever paid a woman was the one which he, in the
                        zenith of his power, paid to this woman. </p>
<p class="block">He was the monarch of the world ... except the part to be
                        reached by his unconquerable foe, the English navy. His name was on every
                        tongue, ... odes and songs were written to him, princes and kings were his
                        guests when they were not his prisoners, he was dazzling, intoxicating and
                        dazing France.... This woman alone kept an even equilibrium ....and not one
                        time would she do him homage. </p>
<p class="">Daffan repeatedly singles out her heroine as the true patriot and counterpart
                        of the great leader, the only one who could persuade others that "it was
                        selfishness and love of personal power that moved the new hero....She and
                        Bonaparte crossed swords and were avowed antagonists. Both were
                        foreigners...." The conflict seems to have the potential to be a
                        Darcy-Elizabeth Bennet or Tracy-Hepburn romance with its emphasis on how
                        they understand each other: he "knew that she understood him; he recognized
                        her power and influence, the magnetic qualities which she exerted upon all
                        who came near her...." Napoleon's emnity and efforts to banish her should be
                        understood as a "compliment."</p>
<p class="block">When he came into power one of his first official acts
                        was to exile her, ... one hundred and twenty miles from Paris under police
                        guard, with instructions "to keep that bird of ill-omen; her appearance
                        bodes mischief." He said of her: "The arrows of Madame de Sta&euml;l could reach
                        a man if he were seated upon a rainbow." </p>
<p class="">The biography abruptly turns to the task of telling the subject's life: of
                        this woman with the capacity to bother the emperor, "a few items are very
                        interesting. Her mother, Madame
                            Neckar, was an unusual and most interesting woman, though
                        severe....She had been a teacher, and her habits of precision and systematic
                        work clung to her; she rarely commended her daughter's work, the nearest
                        approach to approval being: "In time I think you may do very well." </p>
<p class="">"Gibbon the great historian had been in their
                        youth greatly attached to Madame Neckar" and remained an admirer and
                        frequent visitor; "he said she was the most learned women he had ever
                            known and entirely free from pedantry."</p>
<p class="block">The daughter stood in great awe of the mother...; when a child she
                        showed literary inclination and wrote dramas, making kings and queens act
                        all of the parts. Her mother discouraged her writing &mdash; in fact, forbade it,
                        so it was to her father that she went for sympathy and encouragement, and to
                        whom she was the more deeply attached. </p>
<p class="block">Her father, M. Neckar,
                        was resident minister from Geneva at the
                            court of Versailles, and later minister of finance under
                            Louis XVI. He was a man of integrity, enjoying the esteem
                        and confidence of the French people, and his culture was very broad. During
                        his residence in Paris his home was the resort of philosophers, orators and
                        artists. </p>
<p class="block">The Bourbon throne was tottering because of the vices of the nobles, the
                        impurity of the clergy, the literature of the infidel writers, ..., and the
                        weakness... of Louis. Taxation was heavy, and the people clamored and
                        rebelled against the tyrannical rule, and their children "cried for bread in
                        the streets." </p>
<p class="">Neckar and others still hoped to prevent revolution, and he "loaned the
                        government two million dollars of his private fortune... but it was too
                        late; more than dollars is required when revolution once lives in men's
                        hearts." Although Neckar was exiled for his exposure of corruption and bad
                        fiscal policy in the government, he was repeatedly recalled to rescue the
                        situation: "the people were wild with delight." </p>
<p class="block">The revolution...had gone too far to be prevented....The mob
                        hastened to Versailles, men, women and children, and it could not be
                        appeased. Neckar fled to his country seat at Coppet and remained until his
                        death. </p>
<p class="block">Mlle. Neckar
                        was not considered
                            beautiful; she was impressive and fascinating, astonishing; she
                        understood the art of complimenting, and she was cordial and
                            generous.
                        While a brilliant conversationalist, she drew to herself the thoughts and
                        confidences of others.... She enjoyed the confidence of all of her friends.
                        She was charitable in speech, leaving unkind things unsaid, and this alone
                        won for her the respect of those who knew her. </p>
<p class="block">She was, altogether, a gracious, delightful woman....She was sought in marriage by many
                            of the best men in Europe. William Pitt, the minister of England, paid
                            her repeated visits and asked her father's permission to pay his
                            addresses to her, as did Count Fersen of Switzerland. Her parents were
                            very exacting in regard to her marriage and were ready to find fault
                            with each suitor in his turn. </p>
<p class="">Here Daffan establishes the desirable qualities of her subject through the
                        prestigious suitors and parents' discrimination. The presenter has already
                        tied her subject to historical events and great men while disposing of the
                        issue of beauty and playing up the childhood or youthful promise, the social
                        talent. Daffan follows custom in identifying parental influence, religion,
                        and the careful upbringing; the subject is herself not ambitious, vain, or
                        husband-hunting:</p>
<p class="block">Her mother was much
                            prejudiced against Catholics and exacted a promise from her daughter
                            that she would marry a Protestant. Her father inquired minutely
                        into the private life and family heritage of each, and there were few young
                        men, though many were considered eligible, whose characters could bear the
                        scrutiny. She was certainly not concerned or harassed with affairs of the
                        heart, her attachments were intellectual and no tax upon her affections. </p>
<p class="block">Baron de Sta&euml;l-Holstein was Swedish
                        minister to Paris, a nobleman of good standing at court, and a Protestant,
                        so her parents decided that he was a proper suitor. In a mechanical sort of
                        way, realizing that her social position was being enhanced, and glad that
                        her parents approved, she became
                            his wife. Her dowry was two million francs a year; she became the
                        center of a brilliant, intellectual circle in Paris, the toast of princes,
                        princesses and noblemen. Later she became a good friend to brave Marie
                        Antoinette. </p>
<p class="">Daffan's account highlights the topos of recognition, in this instance
                        friendship with a queen: "The queen received her at court, giving special
                        entertainments in her honor, and invited her to visit at the royal country
                        houses." The friendship was rewarded when "in the dark days of the
                        revolution" (note the trope of darkness) the queen was defended
                        and comforted by Mme. de Sta&euml;l. This benevolent picture contrasts sharply
                        with the next relationship, her marriage. Daffan is direct: "it was not a
                        happy one." The fault is his character and their incompatibility: "He was
                        extravagant and self-indulgent... he could not rise to the plane upon which
                        she lived and thought. As they "grew very tired of each other," they were
                        soon "separated." </p>
<p class="block">After as before the separation her home was the resort of
                        intellectual Paris. She remained in the city in the midst of the seething
                        revolutionary mass, her advice being constantly sought by Narbonne,
                        Lafayette, Talleyrand and others identified with the awful times. Hers was
                        the home of wit and wisdom. She discussed and wrote about all of the affairs
                        of the day in a manner all her own, and with all of its sparkle and
                        brilliancy her mind was fundamental, practical and far-seeing. </p>
<p class="block">She understood people, she could draw them out and anticipate
                        them; ... her idea of justice was clear and true; and how many women &mdash; the
                        best women &mdash; have any conception of justice? They can condemn a wrong,
                        sustain a right, love their own, and some have toleration; but how many
                        women are just? </p>
<p class="">This fulsome praise of a peer of great men (who is their charming hostess)
                        leads to a gratuitous swipe at women in general (which goes on to rephrase
                        the rhetorical question once more).  The
                        heroine not only grasps masculine moral code but also writes like and with a
                        man: "She wrote Talleyrand's report on public instruction in 1790, which is
                        said to have been the best exhibit of its kind ever published." Further, she
                        managed the careers and promotions of Narbonne, Talleyrand and other
                        ministers, as she shaped "public opinion." </p>
<p class="block">The entire burden of her thought was "Liberty."  She ...never
                        ceased her efforts for the cause of the people, risking her health, often
                        her life, in her efforts to save Robespierre's victims. During his
                        ascendancy she published many powerful defenses advocating liberty, and her
                        work was read everywhere. </p>
<p class="">During the
                        Reign of Terror, she "saved the lives of many. She had many miraculous
                        escapes from assassination; upon one occasion her
                        carriage was held eight hours by the assembly, while she waited for the
                        decision of the council." This is an exception in Daffan's narrative, when
                        fabula (or baseline story) and story (or discourse, the way it is told)
                        share the same time or duration; that is, a scene or episode. As in many women's biographies,
                        it is a kind of threatened captivity narrative in which the heroine brings
                        out virtue in one of the most unredeemable men in a lower class mob.</p>
<p class="block">Employed assassins, their arms and bodies covered with blood,
                        their hard cruel faces indicating that they were equal to their beastly
                        work, passed all around her. When the mob attempted to seize her carriage a
                        strong man mounted the box and vigorously defended It. He killed four of the
                        ruffians, beat the others away with the heavy carriage-whip, called a body
                        of armed men to his assistance, and drove her safely through the city. She
                        learned later that it was the notorious Sauterre, the bloodiest, fiercest
                        criminal in Paris, who afterwards conducted the execution of Louis XVI, ordering the drummers to drown the last
                        words of the king.</p>
<p class="">Daffan attempts to explain the good deed on the part of a villain in the
                        drama of the
                        French Revolution. "Sauterre had seen M. Neckar distribute corn to the poor
                        in Paris"; Sauterre's "bloodthirstiness" could nevertheless be controlled by
                        "gratitude," an example that no one is entirely evil (and an opportunity to
                        turn the narrative to instructive purpose).
                    </p>
<p class="">At this time, Madame de Sta&euml;l fled to Geneva, "from the horrors of the
                        commune...to the quiet retreat" with friends. "Hospitality was extended to
                        ...every traveler who asked for shelter...; this home was a refuge to the
                        unhappy ones fleeing from the terrors in Paris. ..." </p>
<p class="block">Madame de Sta&euml;l never ceased to watch the rapidly growing power
                        of the Corsican; ....It was only a matter of time....before he would extend
                        this power over Europe. No one seemed to understand him as she did...She
                        felt his vanity, utter heartlessness and his total disregard for the real
                        needs of the people... and ...his passion to conquer at any cost....His
                        brothers, Lucien and Joseph, were her good friends and visited her until
                        forbidden by their brother. </p>
<p class="block">A great mass meeting was held in Paris and a bold speech was
                        made on the "rising tyranny." The people were much impressed with it and
                        Bonaparte at once suspected that Madame de Sta&euml;l had prompted it. He
                        declared through the press that "he did love the republic; that he did love
                        the people," and he openly denounced Madame de Sta&euml;l. He declared that all
                        who visited her home "were less his friends when they came away than when
                        they entered." She knew to what extent Bonaparte would carry his designs, so
                        she again fled from Paris, fearing imprisonment. </p>
<p class="">The pattern of exile and return becomes a bit blurred in Daffan's account;
                        the theme remains the heroine's talent, goodness, and historical prominence
                        in her tug of war with Napoleon. At the same time, she is  a loving nurse of a dying husband, an
                        inspiring focus of a salon, and a suffering exile. She tended "Baron de
                        Sta&euml;l, who was in his last illness...., giving him every care and attention.
                        After his death she retired to Coppet.... Artists, writers, philosophers and
                        orators found a home with her, for to be near her was to be electrified."
                        Her "talent" and strong passions made her more sensitive to "the exile and
                        the tyranny to which she was subjected." Drawn to the metropolis, she set up
                        residence "within twenty leagues...but when Bonaparte heard that the road to
                        her home was constantly thronged with visitors," he exiled her "forty
                        leagues, giving her only two days' notice." </p>
<p class="">A phase of her
                        "broken-hearted" wanderings led to the Prussian court, where she met
                        recognition of kindly Queen Louise, but "this German hospitality" could
                        hardly substitute for her cultural homeland. "She met Goethe and Schiller
                        and other bright lights then shedding luster in literary circles, but she
                        refused to be comforted and thought constantly of Paris and how she should
                        manage to return." </p>
<p class="block">Her health became impaired, and her son interviewed Bonaparte in regard to his
                        mother's return to her beloved city. The autocratic emperor was unrelenting
                        &mdash; he said positively and cruelly: "She would not be six months in Paris
                        before I should be compelled to send her to the temple. * * * I would regret
                        this, for it might injure me in public opinion. She will commit follies, she
                        will have the world about her." </p>
<p class="block">After completing her book "Allemagne," she moved near enough to
                        Paris to receive regularly and to correct proof sheets; for months she
                        worked diligently on this cherished volume. As soon as the ten thousand
                        copies were printed, Napoleon ordered them destroyed, and this order was
                        carried out to the letter. The only reason ever given for the destroying of
                        this work was the fact that she had chronicled nothing in praise of the
                        proud, haughty, egotistical emperor, and he was unwilling for posterity to
                        read a volume written in his day which did not exalt and glorify him. </p>
<p class="block">Humbled..., a sad, broken woman, she retired to Geneva, and here
                        came a chapter in her life entirely new and unexpected &mdash; unexpected to her
                        as it was to those who looked on and wondered. </p>
<p class="block">She met and very soon married a young officer in the French army, Rocca, of Spanish or Italian
                        extraction. To explain why she did this... would be impossible. Rocca was
                        twenty-five and she forty-five years of age; he was a weak-bodied,
                        dilapidated officer, though accomplished somewhat, and he wielded a strange
                        influence over her.... Her friends discouraged Rocca's attentions, but he
                        replied that "he would love her so much that he would finish by making her
                        marry him." </p>
<p class="">Daffan believes Madame de Sta&euml;l was weary of exile, starved for love; all her friends
                        including fellow-heroine-of-Revolution Madame Recamier, were exiled. She and Roca could
                        not return to Paris on pain of death, so they and children made the arduous
                        journey to England "through Russia, Austria and Sweden, everywhere being
                        placed under greatest peril and difficulty." Recognition sweetened the
                        journey, however: "Alexander, czar of Russia, offered her courtesies, as did
                        Bernadotte, the general who had become king of Sweden. Toward the end of
                        this journey she became much 'the woman of the hour,' and in England was
                        given an ovation." </p>
<p class="block">The English people took special delight in entertaining her, ...
                        and giving her every opportunity to display her accomplishments and talents.
                        They did this partly from their real appreciation of her, and partly from
                        the satisfaction of honoring one who was so antagonistic to their great
                        enemy. All of Europe knew of the continued exile ... and... watched with
                        interest. </p>
<p class="">Daffan's narrative repeatedly personifies Europe as audience: "Europe looked
                        on now, guessing at the next shift of scene," as Napoleon abdicated and went
                        to Elba and "Madame de Sta&euml;l returned to her beloved Paris" to preside over
                        "salons" starring "the representative men and women of Russia, England and
                        France. Alexander of Russia and the Duke of Wellington were constant and
                        admiring visitors." </p>
<p class="block">Her friends vied with each other to do her homage, and at this
                        time she was nearer being really happy than she had been since her father's
                        death. She glowed under the light of friendship and drew, as a magnet, all
                        people of her kind unto her. When Napoleon returned from Elba she fled
                        again, fearing him and never believing in him. </p>
<p class="">Although Napoleon invited a reconciliation, she "remained away from Paris
                        until after his final defeat." Napoleon at St. Helena seems, in this
                        account, to deprive his antagonist of purpose, in what ought to be a
                        domestic idyll, reward for a life's principled struggle: "When she
                        no longer had to fight and force her way, somehow life lost zest and
                        animation. She spent the days quietly with Rocca and their children; his
                        attentions and tenderness making life calm and sweet." Daffan's text appears
                        to attempt closure several times in successive paragraphs, seeking the
                        defining accomplishment or attachment, including her writings.</p>
<p class="block">In her last interview with Chateaubriand, when they were going
                        over their interesting lives together, their narrow escapes and wonderful
                        experiences, she told him that she had endured much, had tolerated many
                        annoying, even ill, conditions; had grown weary under the burden of
                        admiration and praise which had so often been hers, that she had tried many
                        times to fancy or believe herself able to love, and to be dependent upon a single personality for
                            happiness, but, as her life was nearing an end, she could look back and
                            realize that the only real love she had ever known in her life was the
                            ardent love which she gave to her father.
                    </p>
<p class="block">She loved God and her country, but alone in her affections stood
                        her estimable father, M. Neckar.
                         She was
                        survived seven months by Rocca. </p>
<p class="block">Napoleon was so dominant in his hostility and so continuous was
                        her exile that she embraced literature as a means of rescue from its monotony. </p>
<p class="block">After her death, July,
                            1817, her "Considerations on the French Revolution" and "Ten Years
                        of Exile" were published. Her best work, "Corinne," is used as a reading
                        book in some of the French schools; as a work of art by many it is not
                        considered strong, but it abounds in admirable phrases, carefully selected
                        words and, more than her other works, bears the stamp of her own
                        personality. </p>
<p class="block">"Allemagne," her book on Germany, was republished in 1867 in
                        Paris. At the same time the books of Napoleon reappeared, both being widely
                        read and generously received. </p>
<p class="block">It is said that her tomb is more often visited than
                        any woman's tomb in Europe. It bears a very unusual epitaph, "Hie tandem
                        quiescat quae unquam quierit" &mdash; "Here rests one who never rested." </p>
<p class="block">
                        Madame de Sta&euml;l had faults and
                            committed errors, but withal she was a great woman. She was persecuted
                            during the best years of her life, and this would have crushed the life
                                out of some women. Her spirit and powers of resistance were
                            wonderful; society and the association with people of her kind was a
                            necessity to her, just as friendship and affection were a necessity to
                            her. Her character and mind ...knew no repose, because she was
                            ambitious....The worst thing that can be said of her is that she was
                            worldly and perhaps vain. She had strong individuality, good nature, a
                            marked power for friendship and a generous, loving heart.
