<p class="notepara"> Second volume by Rev. George Jerment. Preface by
       George Jerment dated Weston Place, May 23, 1804: "among the <i>British</i>
       writers on this subject, the late Dr. <i>Gibbons</i> holds the most eminent
       place. His <i>two</i> volumes are here compressed into one, the less
       important or extraneous matter in his collection being omitted. Some, though very few, of the
        <i>lives</i> in his volumes are, for the same reason, entirely left out"
       (ital in orig; x). Jerment used "various sources" for second volume, and only wrote a few
       himself. Whereas Gibbons's original 2-vol. work included only subjects who were English and
       "in high life," Jerment's second volume includes "NINE <i>Scots</i> women,
       of various ranks, who were remarkably <i>pious</i>" (x-xi). 2 pp. catalogue
       at end: Ogle in London, Glasgow; Ogle and Aikin, Edinburgh, mostly sermons. </p>
