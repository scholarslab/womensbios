<p class="" id="N10659_p">DOROTHY WYNDLOW PATTISON was born at Hauxwell, near Richmond, Yorkshire, England, on January 16th,
                            1832, the eleventh of twelve children (the tenth daughter) of the
                            Rev. Mark James Pattison
                        (1788-1865) and Jane Winn
                            (1793-1860), daughter of a banker and former mayor of
                        Richmond. Rev. Pattison was strictly evangelical and mentally unstable; his
                            wife was induced to commit him to an asylum for almost a year in
                        1834-1835. The eldest son, Mark Pattison
                        (1813-1884), became an Oxford don and for a time joined the
                            high-church Oxford Movement. The father tried to cut off all communication
                        between the nine sisters at home and this supposed Papist infection, though
                        Mark fostered Dorothy's education and she was often his companion on holidays and visits.
                            The
                        tension between father and son set the stage for Dorothy's non-dogmatic
                        religious fervor, but in her career she broke away from both father and
                            brother.

<p class="">Many biographies depict a happy childhood for the somewhat frail but
                        beautiful child whom her father's called his "Little Sunshine."
                        Dorothy is
                        said to have "inherited from her father, who was of a Devonshire family,
                        that finely proportioned and graceful figure... and from her mother...those
                        lovely features which drew forth the admiration of everyone who had the
                        pleasure of knowing her" (M + S, 241). The sisters were occupied in caring
                        for their ailing mother, works of charity among the villagers, and outdoor
                        exercise, including Dorothy's great pleasure, riding to hounds. Yet the
                        father gave formal education to his two sons only, resisted all suitors and
                        disowned the daughters who married, and tried in every way to contain his
                        daughters and wife within the home and according to his will. Biographies of
                        Dorothy emphasize her innate strong will, source of the greatness as well as
                        the difficulties of her life.</p>
<p class="">Although Dorothy wished to join <a href="featured%3Fid=FLORENCE_NIGHTINGALE.html">Florence
                            Nightingale</a> as a nurse during the Crimean War (1853-1856), her father forbade
                        her to leave home, pointing out that without training, she would be "worse
                        than useless" on the front.</p>
<p class="">Most biographies omit what the ODNB matter-of-factly understates: "Tall and
                            pretty, Dorothy Pattison was in love with several men during her life, both before and after
                            she took religious vows."
                        An engagement to a handsome farmer
                            and soon another to a respectable clergymen both came to nothing,
                        under the disapproval of her family and her own reluctance to give up her
                        vocation for anything less than passion.</p>
<p class="">After Dorothy's mother
                        died
                        in 1861,
                        Dorothy won the great point of independence, serving as village
                        schoolmistress at Little Woolston,
                        Buckinghamshire, for three years. There, "She had to live alone in a
                        cottage, and do everything for her self; but the people never for a moment
                        doubted she was a real lady, and always treated her with great respect" (M +
                        S 242).</p>
<p class="">One of her frequent illnesses led her to take a holiday to
                        recuperate at Coatham, near
                        Middlesborough, where she visited an Anglican sisterhood and observed their
                        work in a convalescent home. In September 1864 she joined the Christ Church sisterhood, adopting
                        the name Sister Dora. Most accounts stress her humiliation under the
                        housework and impersonal discipline, though she has already prided herself
                        on being able to cook. 
                        Many accounts
                        tell of her bursting into tears "when the beds which she had just put in
                        order were all pulled to pieces by some superior authority, who did not
                        approve of the method in which they were made" (M + S 242).</p>
<p class="">The sisterhood trained and then dispatched nurses to small hospitals and
                        private patients, and for some years Sister Dora's assignments frequently
                        changed. In January 1865 she was sent to Walsall, a manufacturing district near Birmingham, where a small cottage hospital had been
                        formed in 1863 for emergency treatment of industrial injuries from the coal
                        mines, iron pits, tanneries, and railways. Her decision to join the
                        sisterhood meant a breach with her  family, who considered the work
                        demeaning; Mark disapproved of her "romance" with self-sacrifice. Many
                        biographies repeat the idea that the sisterhood prevented her from attending
                        her father's deathbed and funeral (1865), and that this led to her decision
                        to leave the sisterhood. More recent accounts make it clear that the breach
                        with the sisterhood came later, when she made her own decisions about her
                        nursing assignments, and that bad relations with her family as well as
                        mistimed messages led to her not going home at that time.</p>
<p class="">The first appearance of volunteer nurses, resembling Catholic nuns, caused
                        some distrust. and there are anecdotes about local people
                        believing that secret rituals were performed in a closed-off room in the
                        hospital. In one anecdote, a boy
                        threw a stone that hit Sister Dora on the forehead, calling her a "Sister of
                        Misery." But soon professional men and workers all were won over by Sister
                        Dora's beauty, humor, graceful manners, and dedicated hard work. By 1867, when a new hospital had
                        to be built, Sister Dora was put in charge, and clearly demonstrated her
                        administrative skills as well as her increasing expertise in treating wounds
                        and illnesses. Religion infused everything she did, from prayers and songs
                        to the stories she told and letters she wrote explaining her vocation, but
                        evidently it was a non-sectarian, populist form of belief that attracted her
                        patients and helped them to recover. She often said when a patient's bell
                        would wake her in the night, "The Master is come, and calleth for thee!"
                        She once wrote to a friend, who was engaging a servant for the hospital,  "this
                            is not an ordinary house, or even a hospital...all who serve
                            here...ought to have one rule, <em>love for God</em>, and
                            then, I need not say, love for their work."</p>
<p class="">All biographies of Sister Dora assemble the picture of an admirable
                        personality, some pushing the limits of credibility toward the heights of
                        sainthood. At the same time, almost all note the flaw that she herself
                        acknowledged, self-will. But without her driving sense of purpose and
                        resistance to obstacles, "it is doubtful whether she could have achieved all
                        she did," as Mabie and Stephen put it (following Lonsdale and Baring-Gould).
                            Women who came to Walsall to
                            study nursing with her (she often had "lady-pupils") objected that
                        she would not let anyone help her and did not delegate well, even that she
                        had little appreciation of women. From a later perspective, Sister Dora
                        seems to have gained power through a version of self-denial not dissimilar
                        to an eating disorder or suicidal tendencies; the famous risks she took with
                        infections make more sense as ways to court death when her own desires were
                        defeated.</p>
<p class="">As noted, the biographies downplay Sister Dora's series of attachments to
                        suitors; most seem unaware of any such possibilities of marriage, though
                        some note that she was severely tested by her love for a medical man, possibly  Redfern Davies, whom she met in
                        Walsall, her equal in many qualities but an unbeliever. After a struggle,
                        she decided to continue her vocation and sustain her dedication to Jesus.
                        Only since the 1930s have letters reappeared that reveal that Sister Dora
                        had a relationship in 1876 with a younger man, an industrialist, Kenyon Jones. Jo Manton considers
                        Sister Dora "the prisoner of her own legend" (306); she had to keep their
                        love a secret. The legend drew upon the beauty, purity, and gentility of a
                        lady, but her vocation permitted considerable bodily intimacy and
                        participation in graphic scenes and physical tasks unusual for the type.</p>
<p class="">There are several episodes of her
                        intimacy with dying or wounded men that combine sympathy, horror, and iconic
                        heroism. One night she came
                            to the home of a man who was dying of small-pox; all his relatives and
                            neighbors had fled, including a woman she had sent to buy a candle, who
                            never returned. As she sat with the man, he asked her, "Sister, kiss me
                            before I die." And as the candle expired, she embraced the man, with his
                            running sores, and sat with him in the darkness all night, finding in
                            the morning that he had died in her arms.
                        Another favorite narrative
                            tells of a boy whose right arm had been crushed by machinery. The
                            surgeon insisted that it must be amputated to save the boy's life, but
                            Sister Dora wished to try to save the limb that meant the boy's
                            livelihood. The surgeon warned her (some accounts consider him offended
                            by her challenge to his authority) that the life of the patient was her
                            responsibility. With three weeks' constant care and prayer to heal the
                            wound, the arm became whole and healthy, and we are told the surgeon was
                            impressed, as the boy was forever grateful. He is said to have gained
                            the nickname "Sister's Arm." There are less common but equally uplifting
                            episodes of her counselling a young dying girl or befriending a
                            convalescent child who never forgot her care; children figure more
                            generally as testimony to Sister Dora's nurturing love. Walsall was full
                            of former patients and family members who remembered her generous,
                            personal care and who would come to see how she was during any illness.
                            Every Sunday "Sister's Arm" would walk many miles to the hospital to ask
                            for Sister Dora, and say "Tell her it's <em>her arm</em>
                            that rang the bell" (Fawcett 190-91)</p>
<p class="">Sister
                        Dora worked with little pause throughout the day and night, visiting all
                        beds, supervising all meals, often skipping her own food or rest. She was
                        seldom seen sitting down. This work was enlivened with a sense of
                        performance and playfulness, singing and telling tales that entertained her
                        patients, whom she gave nicknames and special notice or favors. Yet the work
                        was repeatedly interrupted by serious illness; she seemed careless about
                        infection, coming in contact with all kinds of disease and exposed to all
                        weathers. </p>
<p class="">Other than her illnesses, her years of service in Walsall are shaped by
                        memorable catastrophes for the workers in the town, events featured in the
                        vividly realist bas-reliefs surrounding the base of the statue that Walsall
                        erected after her death. One
                            was colliery disaster in 1872, and another was an explosion in 1875 of a
                            furnace at Birchett's Iron Works which covered eleven men in molten
                            metal.
                         For ten days
                        without resting Sister Dora bravely tended to the victims in a special ward
                        that pupil-nurses and doctors were loath to enter, faced with the stench,
                        the cries, and the sight of charred bodies. Only two men survived. Yet another heroic episode
                            came with a renewed epidemic of small-pox; to convince the people to go
                            to a quarantine hospital, Sister Dora volunteered to place herself in
                            isolation there. She showed no concern for her own risk, but it meant
                            many months of hard labor because there were only a few unreliable
                            servants.</p>
<p class="">Contemporary newspapers before and after her death began to record the
                        remarkable deeds of this self-sacrificing servant of the suffering poor. Her
                        medical colleagues attested to her skill in various branches of care, from
                        surgery to the dressing of wounds to the treatment of eye injuries; late in
                        life she studied the work of Lister on antiseptic treatment in London, but
                        she had chosen not to pursue further medical training in favor of her
                        particular hands-on mission among the workers. This mission included
                        rounding up prostitutes and clearing out the pubs for midnight prayer meetings in the
                        town. Many locals recalled her with reverence as a kind of saint, and some
                        believed she could work miracles. Gifts and testimonials included a pony and
                        cart given to her by railway men; she used it to make house calls, and to
                        take convalescents on jaunts. She particularly liked to use her own funds to
                        sponsor feasts for patients and holidays for the poor children who were
                        recovering from illness or injury. She hid the records of the extent of her
                        charities.</p>
<p class="">For many months she also kept secret her mortal illness, an
                        inoperable breast cancer, continuing to work as long as she could and
                        planning the construction and move into a new hospital that was begun in
                        1877. Here, a passage in Baring-Gould and Mabie and Stephen offers a
                        portrait of the heroine's motives:</p>
<p class="block">She could not endure pity. She, to whom everybody had learnt
                        instinctively to turn for help and consolation, on whom others leant for
                        support, must she now come down to ask of them sympathy and comfort? The
                        pride of life was still surging up in her, that pride which had made her
                        glory in her physical strength for its own sake, as well as for its manifold
                        uses in the service of her Master. True, she had been long living two lives
                        inseparably blended: the outward life of hard, unceasing toil; the inner, a
                        constant communion with the unseen world, the existence of which she
                        realised to an extent which not even those who saw the most of her could
                        appreciate. To all the poor, ignorant beings whose souls she tried to reach
                        by means of their maimed bodies, she was, indeed, the personification of all
                        that they could conceive as lovable, holy and merciful in the Saviour. (M+S
                        259)</p>
<p class="">After a brief holiday, she returned to Walsall in her final illness, and died on 24 December, 1878. Her
                        last wish, they say, was to die alone. And some said, and had to be convinced
                        otherwise, that she converted to Catholicism on her deathbed.</p>
<p class="">Her funeral
                        on the 28th of December was a town spectacle, a procession of thousands. In
                        1886, a statue by Francis Williamson was erected in another public ceremony,
                        following upon a stained-glass window in St. Matthew's Church (1882-1883). </p>
<p class="">The Walsall writer of "A Review," quoted by Baring-Gould and Mabie and
                        Stephens, concludes:</p>
<p class="block">She
                            is no idol to us, but we worship her memory as the most saintly thing
                            that was ever given us. Her name is immortalised, both by her own
                            surpassing goodness, and by the love of a whole people for her&mdash;a love
                            that will survive through generations, and give a magic and a music to
                            those simple words, "Sister Dora," long after we shall have passed away.
                            There was little we could ever do&mdash;there was nothing she would let us
                            do&mdash;to relieve the self-imposed rigours of her life; but we love her in
                            all sincerity, and now in our helplessness we find a serene joy in the
                            knowledge that to her, as surely as to any human soul, will be spoken
                            the divine words: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these
                            my brethren, ye have done it unto Me."(M + S 264)</p>
<p class="">Sister Dora's reputation as a modern saint was international for some
                        decades. She appeared in as many as twenty collective biographies besides
                        numerous biographical reference works and countless essays and articles. And
                        even Susan McGann's 2004 biography in ODNB ends with this same quotation
                        from Matthew 25:40.</p>

<br>Margaret Lonsdale's seminal biography about the life and work of
                                Sister Dora. The first ("Copyright") edition, vol. 1911 in
                                Collection of British Authors, Leipzig: Tauchnitz, 1880 (with "The
                                right of translation is reserved," this was a standard imprint to
                                establish copyright), has the epigraph from Spenser and the
                                frontispiece portrait of Sister Dora that is adapted in many
                                illustrations; it is essentially the photograph credited to Mrs.
                                Williams, Wolverhampton, in our "carousel" above. Unlike later
                                editions, the first edition presents this frontispiece above a
                                printed script "signature" of the subject and at the bottom of the
                                page an illegible (apparently holograph) identification of the
                                image. Lonsdale in the preface (in later editions, "Preface to the
                                First Edition") faults this portrait: "Mr. Jeens was seriously ill
                                when he undertook it," so it lacks the "spirit" of the living
                                original and the photograph (Little, Brown, 1880: iii-iv). This
                                preface also explains that Lonsdale has preferred to avoid the "many
                                stories...possessing an element of the marvellous, nay, of the
                                supernatural, which would have made her biography sensational, as
                                well as more interesting....I never heard one of these stories from
                                her own lips"; they arose from "the veneration...by the ignorant and
                                the superstitious, as well as by the credulous among the educated"
                                (iv-v)."Preface to the Fourth Edition," dated January 31, 1880, notes
                                deletions of letters (included in second and third editions)
                                concerning Sister Dora's deathbed conversion: she in fact "never
                                became a member of the Roman Catholic Church" (268). Lonsdale has
                                also removed mention of autopsy (vii-viii). She alludes to an outcry
                                against her in Walsall, and insists that Sister Dora wanted her own
                                life to be written; in final "justification," Lonsdale adds that
                                this life is "public property," not the exclusive treasure of
                                Walsall (viii-ix). With these alterations, the American editions are
                                "From the Sixth English Edition," and those in 1880-1881 through
                                1914 (32nd ed.) appear to use identical plates, though pagination
                                varies depending on whether it begins with front matter or chapter
                                one. London: Kegan Paul, 1881 omits the preface to the fourth
                                edition. Links through Google Books and Internet Archive. </li>
