<p class="">Both
                        narratives soon open a paragraph with the heroine&rsquo;s birth in March,
                            1754 (&ldquo;a year after Marie Antoinette&rdquo; [WB 137]), in
                        Paris, daughter of an engraver. For Russell, the young girl
                        represents a lesson in ideology, a tug-of-war between her mother&rsquo;s Christianity and her father&rsquo;s
                        &ldquo;gospel according to Voltaire and Rousseau.&rdquo;
                            The father,
                            &ldquo;Gratien Philipon,&hellip;held the idea of God to be an illusion;
                        Church and State confederate despotisms, cemented by force and hypocrisy;
                        the unequal distribution of wealth a crime against humanity&hellip;&rdquo; Both Russell
                        and Wilmot-Buxton appear to regard the father&rsquo;s bad character as the root
                        cause of the subject&rsquo;s suffering heroism: &ldquo;the alchemy of a morose and
                        envious spirit&rdquo; turned all circumstances into &ldquo;witnesses against the
                        providence of God and the justice of man&rdquo; for this bad father (R 40):
                        M.Philipon&rsquo;s resentment of social inequality combined with greed,
                        intemperance, and speculation led to poverty. His beautiful and intelligent
                        daughter, the only surviving child of eight, had no future without &ldquo;rank and
                        wealth&rdquo; (R 40-1). Like many a hypocritical politician, M.Philipon was a
                        domestic despot who wasted family resources in &ldquo;low debauchery&rdquo; (R 41); only
                        his wife Margaret Binant, prudent, faithful, beautiful, stayed the
                        family&rsquo;s &ldquo;downward progress&rdquo; and protected the precocious daughter from evil
                        influence. Having established the parental characters, Russell turns to the
                        topic of talent: </p>
<p class="block">Jeanne Manon's educational progress was
                        singularly rapid. At four years of age she read perfectly, without clearly
                        remembering, she says, the process by which that faculty was acquired; and,
                        assisted by competent instructors, she became, whilst yet the merest girl,
                        sufficiently mistress of the ordinary accomplishments, as well useful as
                        ornamental, that made up the education of a carefully-nurtured daughter of a
                        Paris shopkeeper. Mademoiselle Philipon had a finely-toned, vibrating voice,
                        and was passionately fond of choral harmony, a power and taste which led to
                        her constant attendance at church, where the imposing pomp of the Catholic worship, with its effective
                        accessories of magnificent music, illuminated altars, gorgeous processions,
                        aided by the constraining example of her mother's blameless life, gave a
                        strong but ephemeral bias to the as yet ductile mind of the enthusiastic
                        young maiden. Writing nearly thirty years afterwards in her
                        prison-cell at Ste. Pelagie, Madame
                        Roland says, "At eleven I found myself deeply
                            religious; at sixteen I was a philosopher; at twenty a sceptic.&rdquo; (R
                        41-2)</p>
<p class="">Russell illustrates the bad tone of Catholic practice as well as bohemian
                        irreverence in society of France at
                        that period. He describes a mock catechism of the little girl by an artist
                        in her father&rsquo;s studio, and an incident when the girl took a translation of
                            Plutarch to church during Lent: &ldquo;To her girlish,
                        undisciplined apprehension, the heroes of the classic biographer were
                        incarnations of the loftiest attributes of humanity; the despotic
                        democracies which they championed, communities of freemen&mdash;model republics!&rdquo;
                        This love of classical ideals shows that &ldquo;this young person&rdquo; could not have
                        felt &ldquo;true reverence&rdquo; for the far different ethos of &ldquo;the religion of
                        humility and compassion, which teaches, in precise opposition to the Greek
                        and Roman morality, that meekness, not pride&mdash;mercy, not vengeance&hellip;&rdquo; (R 43).
                        Wilmot-Buxton, who places discussion of Manon&rsquo;s reading after the episode of
                        illness that we turn to next, regards Plutarch as a high point of the girl&rsquo;s
                        avid reading rather than a corrupting influence: &ldquo;This book, with its series
                        of noble lives, its vivid pictures of Greece and Rome, not only
                        opened a new world to the little maiden; it made her a Republican&rdquo; (WB 140).</p>
<p class="">Wilmot-Buxton is less the advocate of Christian moral progress, and cuts
                        quickly to the anecdote that Russell in due course relates as well: an
                        illness that defines character. &ldquo;One of the scenes
                        which the woman of forty, waiting for death in her wretched cell, remembered
                        most clearly was an early contest of will between her father and herself&rdquo;
                        (WB 138). &ldquo;Whilst her brain was still throbbing with the
                        fresh enthusiasm kindled by the magic pages of Plutarch, an illness,
                        requiring to be promptly dealt with, attacked her, and she was ordered to
                        take some extremely nauseous medicine: she refused to do so, and twice her
                        father, in spite of Madame Philipon's remonstrances, severely whipped her&rdquo;
                        (R 43). Wilmot-Buxton presents a scene in which Manon is trying to swallow the
                        smelly dose when her father flies into a rage at her &ldquo;obstinacy&rdquo; and whips
                        her. When Manon &ldquo;hardened herself and declared amidst
                        sobs and tears that she would try no more to swallow it,&rdquo; the father whipped
                        her the second time. It was the threat of a third whipping that roused the
                        Spartan spirit, in both versions: &ldquo;As the threat left M.
                        Philipon's lips, the resolution of the imitative Spartan girl was taken; her
                        cries and tears ceased instantly, and turning towards her father, with a
                        look of calm disdain, she deliberately repeated her refusal to swallow the
                        medicine, lifted her clothes with her own hand, and invited him to fulfil
                        his threat! Madame Philipon now resolutely interposed&hellip;&rdquo; (R 43). Russell&rsquo;s
                        version ends in a reconciliation of the nurturing mother and docile
                        six-year-old patient. Wilmot-Buxton concludes with direct quotation of the
                        common source, Madame Roland&rsquo;s own memoir: &ldquo;&rsquo;They might have killed me on the
                        spot&rsquo;&hellip;&rsquo;without my uttering so much as a sigh; nor will it cost me more
                        to-day to ascend the guillotine than it did then to yield to a barbarous
                        treatment&rdquo; (WB 138).</p>
<p class="">In both narratives, the father rather than the child is conquered by this
                        incident; the mother is allowed to manage the girl&rsquo;s upbringing: &ldquo;Madame
                        Philipon's precepts and example must about this time have obtained a signal
                        ascendancy&rdquo; (R 44) over her daughter's mind. In both narratives, Manon becomes
                        a devout Christian, her vocation confirmed when, as her first communion
                        approached in 1764, she begged to be allowed to enter a
                        convent: she spent a year as a lay boarder at the &ldquo;Convent of the Congregation, a building which stood
                        next the prison in which she was afterwards to be confined&rdquo; (WB
                        141). A child given to religious raptures, she turned her passions in more
                        &ldquo;natural channels,&rdquo; friendships with another girl pupil and a lay nun (WB
                        142). From the convent she went, in the following year, to live with her
                        grandmother and aunt. For Russell, this is from the frying pan into the
                        fire, from torrid saints&rsquo; legends to Voltaire and
                            Rousseau, reading &ldquo;by the aid whereof the Christian maiden
                        rapidly grew&mdash;or ought I to write, shrank?&mdash;into a strong-minded <em>jeune philosophe</em>, with a strong tendency, helped by
                        the unquiet spirit of the time, towards ultra-democratic theories of civil
                        polity&rdquo; (R 45). Manon recalled taking offense at the patronizing treatment
                        of grandes dames and the familiarity of servants when she was taken on
                        visits to great houses. A visit to Versailles &ldquo;inflamed&rdquo; her republicanism, her desire for &ldquo;freedom
                        and equality&rdquo;; Russell exclaims: &ldquo;Error! Mademoiselle
                        Philipon! Illusion ! <em>jeune philosophe</em>, and of a
                        gross and very common-place kind.&rdquo; Not only were the Romans &ldquo;aristocratic
                        despots,&rdquo; but someone of her rare talent should never aspire to be equal to
                        the ordinary crowd (R 46).</p>
<p class="">Both Russell and Wilmot-Buxton turn to the description of the young
                        marriageable woman, Russell emphasizing her influence on all who beheld her,
                        including merchants and suitors. She rejected a
                        prosperous butcher: "What! shall I, who have
                        lived with Plato; with all the philosophers, unite myself with a
                        shopkeeper!" Russell compares various descriptions of Manon&rsquo;s
                        beauty, &ldquo;with considerable diversity of colouring&hellip;. Lamartine says she was
                        of tall, lithe figure, had black silken hair, blue eyes, the nose of a Greek
                        statue, superb teeth, a beautiful smile, and a melodious voice. The
                        pen-and-ink sketch drawn by her own hand is a curious specimen of
                            self-painting:&mdash;&lsquo;I am five feet five inches in
                            height, have a well-made leg, and my foot is well set on; my chest is
                            broad and nobly decorated. My carriage is graceful, and my face has a
                            great deal of colour, with much softness and expression. No single
                            feature, perhaps, is strictly beautiful, but taken together could not
                            but please. My mouth is a little wide, you may see a prettier every day,
                            but not one with a smile more tender and engaging. My eyes are fine and
                            well opened, and the colour of the iris is hazel; and my look is open,
                            frank, tender, varying in expression with the emotions of the
                            affectionate heart of which it indicates the movements, and if, serene
                            and lofty, it sometimes astonishes, it charms much more. My hair is dark
                            brown; my nose I used to think too full at the end, but taken with the
                            rest, especially in profile, it is not amiss&rsquo;" (R 48). </p>
<p class="">Manon lost the protection and guidance of her mother, who had held the family
                        business together. Her father brought his mistress into the home, and Manon
                        sought some dignity and independence in the convent. Her old friend from Amiens introduced
                            M.Roland, &ldquo;a well-descended gentleman of ability, fortune, and
                        literary tastes, who had long held the important post of Inspector of
                        Manufactures&rdquo; (R 49), who impressed Manon with his easy manners and
                        learning, in spite of his age. Roland proposed marriage, but was
                        discouraged by M.Philipon&rsquo;s refusal to give his daughter&rsquo;s hand to someone
                        who openly disapproved of M.Philipon&rsquo;s irregular living arrangement. Manon
                        was disillusioned and embittered when M.Roland accepted this rejection and
                        went away, but in due course he returned to the convent and urged Manon to
                        marry him; the wedding took place in 1780; they had one daughter,
                            Eudora. &ldquo;The wedding tour of M. and Madame Roland
                        extended to Switzerland and England, with which last-named
                        country and its institutions Madame was upon the whole reasonably satisfied,
                        seeing &lsquo;that in England man at least was something&rsquo;" (R 51).</p>
<p class="">From Roland&rsquo;s
                        estate in Amiens, and then near Lyons (Russell and Wilmot-Buxton differ
                        in their accounts of the estate and the political developments), and in
                        recurrent trips to Paris, Madame Roland
                        participated in the political changes that led to the Revolution. M. Roland was
                        elected to the newly revived National Assembly and became Minister of the
                        Interior, and Madame Roland actively hosted salons and wrote for the
                        Girondists. Wilmot-Buxton follows closely the stages of the catastrophe, with excerpts
                        from Madame Roland&rsquo;s correspondence, detailing her
                        personal conflicts with Danton&mdash;&ldquo;her <em>b&ecirc;te noir</em>
                        Danton exclaim[ed], &lsquo;Why not invite Madame Roland to the Ministry too?
                        Everyone knows that Roland is not alone in office&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;and
                        Marat&mdash;&ldquo;the envenomed eyes of Marat and his friends were on her
                        with no friendly gaze,&rdquo; ready to seize evidence that the Rolands were
                        traitors to the cause against the King (WB 156). </p>
<p class="">Russell is less interested in the political history, emphasizing rather the
                        erring heroine&rsquo;s drama: </p>
<p class="block">Madame herself was the real minister whose
                        hand traced the official letters, dispatches, the telling reports and
                        speeches, which her husband copied and read; albeit Madame herself only
                        modestly claims "to
                            have infused into her husband's writings that union of gentleness, of
                            reasoning and sentiment, which only a woman can combine." That
                        troubled and fantastic dream has passed away; and now, towards the close of
                            1793, the deputies of the Gironde, having celebrated their
                        last supper&mdash;a profuse banquet, brilliant with lights and flowers, and
                        enlivened by wine and eloquent speeches, to be thereafter carefully
                        reported, touching the possibility of God and Immortality,&mdash;have followed
                            Louis to the scaffold; and Madame
                        Roland herself, who might, like her husband, have escaped the clutch of the
                        assassins, but disdained to do so, has been arrested, and awaits in St. Pelagie the purely formal and
                        inevitable decree of death, amusing herself meanwhile in writing memoirs,
                        and passionate appeals to the Terrorists for justice in the name&mdash;poor prisoned maniac!&mdash;
                        of the sacred principles consecrated by the Revolution! Riouffe
                        and other prisoners were enthusiastic in their admiration of the unquailing
                        courage of the queenly woman. "Ah," sadly replied her female attendant, "you do
                            not know all: before you, Madame calls up all her courage, but when in
                            her own room, she sometimes stands for hours together, leaning against
                            the window and weeping bitterly." (R 52)</p>
<p class="">Wilmot-Buxton&rsquo;s vivid, detailed account of the events of this period,
                        which included Madame Roland's repeated imprisonment and release,
                        interconnects this heroine with the story of Charlotte
                            Corday, whose assassination of
                            Marat sealed the fate of the imprisoned Girondistes.
                        Russell appears eager to get to the climax of execution:</p>
<p class="block">At length, on the 9th November,
                            1793, Madame Roland stood before Fouquier Tinville's
                        tribunal; was not, of course, permitted to be heard, and received sentence,
                        which, upon returning to the prison, she communicated to her fellow captives
                        by passing her hand sharply across her throat. Early on the following morning, the
                        still beautiful woman&mdash;she was in her thirty-ninth year only, and the
                        peculiar character of her physiognomy reduced her apparent age by at least
                        ten years&mdash;was bound in a cart, and slowly conveyed to
                        execution. She was habited in a white muslin robe, her dark abundant tresses
                        waved freely in the wind, and a smile of haughty scorn curled her
                            finely-chiseled lips as they murmured, in reply to
                        the hooting crowd who continued to shout "<em>A la guillotine ! a la
                                guillotine!</em>"&mdash;"I am going to the guillotine; they who send me
                            there will soon follow, and you will hoot them also."
                        Lamarche, an old man, fettered in the same cart, was
                        overwhelmed with terror, which Madame Roland strove vainly to dispel, and
                        passing a tall column, on the summit of which a statue of Liberty had been
                        placed, she exclaimed, "O Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name!" Another
                        expression, of much greater significance and interest, is not so well
                        known:&mdash; "Can I have
                            pen and paper?&rdquo; she said, addressing the official who received her at
                            the foot of the scaffold; &ldquo;I would, if possible, write down the strange
                            thoughts that are rising in my mind." The request was brutally
                        refused, and a few moments afterwards Madame Roland had thought her last on
                        earth!</p>
<p class="block">The best evidence of the true womanly worth of Madame Roland is
                        seen in the effect which her execution produced upon the minds of her
                        husband and servants. M. Roland, as his
                        wife predicted he would, slew himself a few hours after the intelligence
                        reached him, "finding it impossible to live in a world where such a crime
                        was permitted." Two servants, a man and woman, burst, in a paroxysm of grief
                        and rage, into Fouquier Tinville's hall of doom, and denounced
                        him and his myrmidons to their faces as villains and murderers. The woman
                        was held to be insane, and dimwitted; the man's audacious tongue was
                        silenced by the guillotine! (R 53)</p>
<p class="">Wilmot-Buxton repeats Madame Roland&rsquo;s last words about liberty. &ldquo;So died
                            the heroine of the Revolution, the representative of all that was fine
                            and pure and good in that great movement towards liberty and the rights
                            of Man.&rdquo; Her name is &ldquo;spoken of
                        with awe and gratitude in the country which owes so much to her generous
                        devotion, her single-hearted love, her untiring patriotism&rdquo; (WB 163).</p>
