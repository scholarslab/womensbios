<p class="" id="N143B2_p">Charlotte Bront&euml; is one of the few
                        writers whose life has assumed as great a presence in the popular
                        imagination as her works themselves. As Lucasta Miller observes in her book
                            <em>The Bront&euml; Myth</em>, a study of the various
                        afterlives of the Bront&euml; sisters through biography, &ldquo;the sisters themselves,
                        plus their entire family, have become mythic figures in their own right.
                        Since 1857, when Elizabeth Gaskell published her famous <em>Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;</em>, hardly a year has gone by
                        without some form of biographical material on the Bront&euml;s appearing&mdash;from
                        articles in newspapers to full-length lives, from images on tea towels to
                        plays, films, and novelizations&rdquo; (Miller, xi). The idea of three sisters,
                        the daughters of a lower middle-class curate living an isolated life in a
                        Yorkshire moorland village, producing some of the most complex and moving
                        literature of the century, turned the Bront&euml;s into celebrities within their
                        lifetime, and their notoriety has only increased over the years. Their
                        childhood home at Haworth Parsonage has become the site of tourist
                        pilgrimages, where enthusiasts travel to see the attic where the children
                        wrote, in miniscule handwriting, their first imaginative tales. As Miller
                        points out, the popular fascination with the lives of the Bront&euml; sisters
                        often threatens to overshadow serious critical interest in their works.
                        Digging through the cultural accretions of myth and fantasy, however, one
                        can see how powerfully the Bront&euml;s&rsquo; lives affected their work, and how they
                        transformed an often bleak and tragic existence, marginalized by their
                        geographic location but also by their gender, into the material for art.
                        Though Anne and Emily were also published novelists and poets, Charlotte was
                        the most prolific of the three, and remains the most popular.</p>

                        geographic location but also by their gender, into the material for art.
                        Though Anne and Emily were also published novelists and poets, Charlotte was
                        the most prolific of the three, and remains the most popular.</p>
<p class="">Charlotte was
                        the third of six children, born to
                            Patrick and Maria Branwell Bront&euml;
                            on April 21, 1816, at the Market Street Parsonage in Thornton, near Bradford in Yorkshire. When Charlotte was four years old,
                        the family moved to the village of
                            Haworth in Yorkshire, where
                        her father had been appointed perpetual curate. Charlotte&rsquo;s mother died shortly thereafter, in 1821, leaving
                            Patrick to raise the young family. (Charlotte&rsquo;s siblings Branwell,
                        Emily, and Anne had been born in 1817, 1818, and 1820, respectively.) The
                        children&rsquo;s aunt, Elizabeth Branwell, came to help care for them.</p>
<p class="">In 1824,
                        Charlotte and Emily were sent to join their two older sisters, Maria and Elizabeth, at the
                            Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire. The traumatic experience they had
                        there, caused by harsh discipline and poor diet, would remain in Charlotte&rsquo;s
                        memory all her life, emerging in her later fiction. The Clergy Daughters'
                        School became Lowood School in <em>Jane Eyre</em>, and its
                        founder, the Reverend William Carus Wilson, was the model for Mr.
                        Brocklehurst, the hypocritical Calvinistic disciplinarian in that novel.
                            An epidemic of typhoid fever broke out at the school, and both Maria and
                        Elizabeth fell victim to the disease. Maria was sent home in February 1825, and died in May. Elizabeth
                        was sent home in late May, and Patrick soon thereafter sent for Charlotte
                        and Emily to be brought back to Haworth as well. Elizabeth died on the 15th of June. Charlotte
                        immortalized her oldest sister Maria as the long-suffering, angelic
                        character Helen Burns in <em>Jane Eyre</em>.</p>
<p class="">Charlotte, Branwell, Emily, and Anne became increasingly close after the loss of their
                        two oldest siblings. Taking refuge from grief in imaginative play, the four
                        children began to make up stories, opposing the arbitrariness of death with
                        the control of authorship. Their first stories took inspiration from a box
                        of Branwell&rsquo;s tin soldiers, but as they outgrew these toys, the children
                        established their tales in worlds of their own creation. Not surprisingly,
                        Charlotte and Branwell dominated their younger sisters in these plays, and
                        eventually the siblings split off into two groups&mdash;Charlotte and Branwell
                        chronicling the imaginary kingdom of Angria, while Emily and Anne created
                        the alternate world of Gondal (Miller, 5). Sibling rivalry fuelled these
                        endeavors, as well as collaboration, and Charlotte often felt threatened by
                        Branwell&rsquo;s early sense of entitlement with regard to the male-dominated
                        world of literary production.</p>
<p class="">Charlotte
                        and her siblings were prolific readers as well as writers. Her novels are
                        steeped in literary and biblical allusion, the product of this wide-ranging
                        education in classical and contemporary writers. &ldquo;Unlike most middle-class
                        Victorian households,&rdquo; writes Christine Alexander, &ldquo;there was little
                        censorship of reading in the Bront&euml; parsonage. The Bible was staple fare;
                        yet Patrick Bront&euml; also encouraged an
                        eclectic diet of Homer, Virgil, Shakespeare, Bunyan, Milton, Pope, Johnson,
                        Gibbon, Cowper, Burns, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott, Southey, and Byron&rdquo;
                        (ODNB). The children also devoured the poetry and prose published in monthly
                        periodicals, such as <em>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</em> and <em>Fraser&rsquo;s</em>.</p>
<p class="">One of the writers who most influenced Charlotte as an emerging writer was
                        Lord Byron (1788-1824). His poetry furnished her imagination with exotic
                        settings and dashing heroes. Byron&rsquo;s legacy, writes Miller, can be seen &ldquo;her
                        obsession with the amours of her aristocratic hero, Zamorna&rdquo; (Miller, 8).
                        Zamorna became the central focus of Charlotte&rsquo;s Angrian tales, and it is
                        clear that he captured her imagination in a manner bordering on
                        hero-worship. Tall, dark and Byronic, Zamorna was charismatic and sexually
                        potent. One can see in Zamorna the embryonic form of Bront&euml;&rsquo;s tortured,
                        brooding hero Mr. Rochester in <em>Jane Eyre</em>, though
                        Charlotte&rsquo;s unqualified admiration for this type of character would become
                        more ambivalent and nuanced over the intervening years.</p>
<p class="">In January
                        1831, Charlotte was sent to the Roe Head
                            School, about 15 miles from home. This second experience with
                        institutional education was much more positive than the first. Charlotte
                        worked hard at her studies, and formed several lasting friendships. Two
                        women in particular would become lifelong friends and correspondents: &ldquo;the
                        conscientious, calm, religious Ellen
                            Nussey who fulfilled Charlotte's dutiful self and need for
                        affection, and the fiercely independent Mary Taylor, whose radical views on politics, women, and religion
                        fuelled Charlotte's ambitious and rebellious nature&rdquo; (ODNB). In many ways
                        these two very different women exemplified a split in Charlotte&rsquo;s nature,
                        which tension would emerge in her writing. Charlotte would often express
                        feelings of doubt and guilt over the working of her &ldquo;fiery imagination&rdquo; in
                        letters to Ellen Nussey, worrying
                        that the content of her writing was not appropriate for a clergyman&rsquo;s
                        daughter (Miller, 12). Though she stayed at Roe Head for only eighteen
                        months as a pupil, Charlotte excelled in French and drawing, as well as
                        continuing to write.</p>
<p class="">Charlotte went back to Haworth briefly, but returned to Roe Head in July
                        1835, this time as a teacher. Charlotte remained there for three and a half
                        years. She soon became impatient however, at the strictures of the life she
                        was leading. Charlotte confessed to her journal her frustrations with her
                        straitjacketed world: &ldquo;The thought came over me: am I to
                            spend all the best part of my life in this wretched bondage, forcibly
                            suppressing my rage at the idleness, the apathy and the hyperbolical and
                            most asinine stupidity of those fatheaded oafs, and on compulsion
                            assuming an air of kindness, patience and assiduity?&rdquo; (ODNB). </p>
<p class="">She continued
                        to harbor literary ambitions secretly while at Roe Head. Once, while on
                        holiday, she sent some of her poems to Robert Southey, the Poet Laureate of
                        England. This was an audacious move, and Charlotte revealed to him in her
                        letter her desire &ldquo;to be forever known&rdquo; (Miller, 10). Southey was gracious
                            enough to write back, but his response was far from encouraging. He
                            admitted that she possessed &ldquo;the faculty of Verse,&rdquo; but declared
                            unequivocally that &ldquo;Literature cannot be the business of a woman&rsquo;s life:
                            &amp; it ought not to be.&rdquo; He advised her to attend to her &ldquo;proper
                            duties&rdquo; as a woman, and to be &ldquo;less eager for celebrity&rdquo; (Miller
                            12). Chastised, Charlotte responded that she attempted to repress
                        herself and conceal her ambitions from those around her. The accusation that
                        her ambitions were &ldquo;unfeminine&rdquo; would plague Charlotte all her life.</p>
<p class="">Charlotte felt increasingly guilty about her continued indulgence of her
                        Angrian fantasies, which nurtured her passionate desire to be loved and
                        understood. John Maynard points to Charlotte&rsquo;s continued obsession with the
                        hyper-masculine Zamorna, while a teacher at Roe Head. At nineteen years of
                        age, escaping the &ldquo;mirthless, lifeless room&rdquo; at the school, she recorded
                        this daydream:</p>
<p class="block">Never shall I, Charlotte Bront&euml;,
                            forget&hellip;how distinctly I, sitting in the school-room at Roe-head, saw the
                            Duke of Zamorna&hellip;his black horse turned loose grazing among the heather,
                            the moonlight so mild and so exquisitely tranquil, sleeping upon that
                            vast and vacant road&hellip;I was quite gone. I had really utterly forgot where
                            I was and all the gloom and cheerlessness of my situation. I felt myself
                            breathing quick and short as I beheld the Duke lifting up his sable
                            crest which undulated as the plume of a hearse waves to the wind, and
                            knew that that music&hellip;was exciting him and quickening his ever rapid
                            pulse. (Maynard, 13-14)</p>
<p class="">Charlotte worried that this kind of passionate fantasy was unwholesome, and
                        confessed her doubts to Ellen Nussey.
                            Nussey&rsquo;s conventional
                            Christian advice only increased Charlotte&rsquo;s sense of her own
                            sinfulness. Charlotte left Roe Head in 1838, chastened and sobered
                        by her experiences, but not quenched in her literary ambition.</p>
<p class="">Returning home, Charlotte continued to write; two more novellas in the
                        Angrian mode concluded her involvement in the saga. &ldquo;Although Angria
                        continued to provide material for future characterization, scene, and
                        theme,&rdquo; writes Alexander, &ldquo;she made a distinct move towards artistic
                        independence from both her brother and her private world&rdquo; (ODNB).</p>
<p class="">In 1839, Charlotte received two proposals of marriage, both of which she
                        refused. The first was from the Reverend Henry Nussey, Ellen&rsquo;s brother. The
                        second was from the Reverend James Bryce, an Irish clergyman whom she barely
                        knew. Nussey&rsquo;s passionless and pious proposal formed the basis for
                        Charlotte&rsquo;s portrayal of St. John Rivers in <em>Jane
                            Eyre</em>. Both Charlotte and Jane&rsquo;s refusal of such matches would have
                        been considered imprudent and even shocking in Bront&euml;&rsquo;s time. It was
                        somewhat radical to refuse a respectable offer and to hold out for a
                        marriage based on love. Either Nussey or Bryce would have been considered an
                        eminently suitable match for Charlotte; if she had accepted one of them, it
                        would have obviated the need to hire herself out as a governess, one of the
                        few respectable career options available to a woman of her class.</p>
<p class="">Following this, Charlotte endured two brief stints as a governess, a position
                        she enjoyed even less than teaching. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s resentment of the treatment
                        she received, and the tendency of the upper classes to treat governesses as
                        subhuman, would emerge in her fiction, much of which dealt with the
                        humiliations endured by women forced to earn their living in these degrading
                        circumstances. </p>
<p class="">Returning home in 1841, Charlotte began to make plans with Emily and Anne to
                        open their own school. However, the sisters felt they could attract more
                        pupils if their language skills were more robust. Plans for the school were
                        postponed in favor of a scheme in which Charlotte and Emily would enroll at
                        a school in Brussels in order to
                        improve their French. The sisters traveled to Belgium in February 1842, and enrolled at the
                        Pensionnat Heger. In Constantin Heger, a professor of French
                        literature, Charlotte finally found a man who challenged her intellectually
                        and encouraged her literary ambitions. Heger was, by all accounts, a strict
                        master, and his comments on the Bront&euml;s&rsquo; French compositions show that he
                        did not spare his criticism, even though he was impressed by the abilities
                        of these young Englishwomen.</p>
<p class="">Charlotte and Emily were called home in
                            October by the death of their Aunt Branwell. Emily decided to stay
                        in England and live off the legacy she had received from their aunt, and
                        Charlotte returned alone to Brussels in January 1843. Madame Heger&rsquo;s increasing
                            coldness towards Charlotte, who was obviously devoted to her husband,
                            alienated Charlotte from the Hegers and contributed to her feelings of
                            loneliness and depression. (She would later use this time in her
                        life as material for her novels <em>The Professor</em> and
                            <em>Villette</em>.) By the end of 1843, Charlotte had
                        decided to return to Haworth.</p>
<p class="">Charlotte&rsquo;s depression deepened upon her return to England. Plans for the girls&rsquo; school fell through, and
                        Charlotte longed for the company of M. Heger. She wrote him a series of
                        increasingly desperate and passionate letters, to which he did not reply.
                        Charlotte&rsquo;s unrequited love tortured her, and she begged Heger to write back
                        to her. Wounded by his silence, Charlotte discontinued her correspondence
                        with him.</p>
<p class="">Her private suffering was compounded by shared family trials, when Branwell was dismissed in disgrace
                        from his post as tutor for having an affair with his employer&rsquo;s wife.
                        Branwell led a dissipated and self-destructive life after this, nursing his
                        addiction to alcohol and opium. Charlotte&rsquo;s brother became a strain on his
                        family and his health began a rapid decline.</p>
<p class="">Once again, Charlotte took refuge from grief in work, focusing on her goal of
                        becoming a published writer. In 1845, she discovered a notebook containing
                        Emily&rsquo;s poetry, and persuaded her that they merited publication. Charlotte,
                        Emily and Anne edited and selected a portion of their verse and submitted it
                        for consideration. They chose androgynous pseudonyms to avoid criticism
                        based on their gender. <em>Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton
                            Bell</em> was published in 1846 by Aylott and Jones, at the authors&rsquo;
                        expense (using money from their aunt&rsquo;s legacy). The book sold only two
                        copies, but received several favorable reviews, which was enough to
                        encourage the sisters to continue.</p>
<p class="">The three began to work on prose next, perfecting their novels in the hopes
                        of publication. Charlotte drew on her Brussels experience for her first
                        novel, <em>The Professor</em>. Emily wrote <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, reworking her Gondal saga in an English
                        setting, and Anne wrote <em>Agnes Grey</em>, based on her
                        life as a governess (ODNB). All three sent their manuscripts to publishers
                        for consideration. <em>Wuthering Heights</em> and <em>Agnes Grey</em> were accepted by Thomas Cautley Newby in
                        July 1847, but <em>The Professor</em> was not so well
                        received. Christine Alexander points out that Charlotte wrote <em>The Professor</em> in reaction against her Angrian
                        fantasies (ODNB). In what is now known as &ldquo;The Farewell to Angria&rdquo; (1839),
                        Charlotte had expressed her determination to &ldquo;quit for awhile that burning
                        clime where we have sojourned too long&hellip;lit with love, flushed with passion,
                        shaded with grief, kindled with ecstasy,&rdquo; and move &ldquo;to a cooler region where
                        the dawn breaks grey and sober&rdquo; (Maynard, 14). Alexander argues that the
                        result of this artistic decision was a novel stiff and detached, not true to
                        its author&rsquo;s emotional experiences and inner knowledge. <em>The Professor</em> was never published during Charlotte&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>
<p class="">However, the firm of Smith, Elder &amp; Co. had offered encouragement in
                        their rejection letter, indicating that they would be interested to read
                        anything Charlotte might send to them in future. By August 1847, Charlotte
                        had sent them the manuscript of <em>Jane Eyre</em>. George
                        Smith, one of the publishers, recorded that he was so engrossed when he
                        began to read the novel that he cancelled his plans to go out riding with a
                        friend and skipped dinner in order to finish it in one sitting (Miller, 16).
                        The next day he wrote to &ldquo;Currer Bell&rdquo; to offer &pound;100 for the copyright. <em>Jane Eyre</em> was published in October 1847 and was an
                        instant bestseller. The novel also received critical acclaim: literary
                        celebrities such as G. H. Lewes and William Makepeace Thackeray praised
                        it.</p>
<p class="">Semi-autobiographical in content, <em>Jane Eyre</em> is the
                        story of an unloved orphan whose experience of suffering and neglect fail to
                        subdue her passion and will to become independent. Charlotte Bront&euml; finally
                        found her voice in <em>Jane Eyre</em>. Casting aside the
                        dispassionate third-person male narration of <em>The
                            Professor</em>, Bront&euml; audaciously adopted the voice of Jane, a
                        first-person female narrator. Jane&rsquo;s insistence on her sense of self-worth
                        and dignity, in spite of her gender and social position, was a powerful
                        critique of mid-Victorian life, and not surprisingly, ruffled quite a few
                        feathers.</p>
<p class="">
<em>Jane Eyre</em>&rsquo;s psychologically astute portrayal of a
                        female voice and perspective led many readers to assume that its author was,
                        in fact, a woman. Some readers, especially women, were shocked by the
                        novel&rsquo;s frank depiction of passionate desire, its discussion of adultery,
                        and sometimes angry and rebellious tone. Elizabeth Rigby (later Lady
                        Eastlake) expressed the disapproval felt by some readers most memorably, in
                        her anonymous critique, published in the <em>Quarterly
                            Review</em> in December 1848. Rigby deplored the novel&rsquo;s &ldquo;coarseness of
                        language and laxity of tone&rdquo; and described Jane&rsquo;s independent spirit as
                        unfeminine. She condemned the novel as &ldquo;anti-Christian&rdquo; and the heroine as
                        &ldquo;the personification of an unregenerate and undisciplined spirit&rdquo; who had
                        &ldquo;the strength of a mere heathen mind which is a law unto itself.&rdquo; If, as had
                        been speculated, the author was indeed a woman, Rigby declared that she must
                        be one who &ldquo;has for some sufficient reason, long forfeited the society of
                        her own sex&rdquo; (Miller, 22-23).</p>
<p class="">It is ironic that the assumption of an androgynous pseudonym, rather than
                        shielding Charlotte from censure, should have led to such vicious gossip and
                        speculation. Charlotte dedicated her second edition of <em>Jane Eyre</em> to Thackeray, unaware that such a move was likely to
                        spark more gossip. Thackeray, like Rochester, had a wife who was mentally
                        ill, leading to rumors that <em>Jane Eyre</em> had been
                        written by Thackeray&rsquo;s mistress.</p>
<p class="">Charlotte finally revealed her true identity to her publishers, after Thomas
                        Newby attempted to capitalize on the popularity of Charlotte&rsquo;s recent novel
                        by claiming that <em>Agnes Grey</em> and <em>Wuthering Heights</em> were written by the same author as <em>Jane Eyre</em>. Charlotte and Anne traveled to London to confirm their identities to
                        Charlotte&rsquo;s publisher George Smith, who welcomed them and took them to the
                        opera, the Royal Academy, and the National Gallery (ODNB).</p>
<p class="">Upon her return to Haworth, Charlotte began work on her next novel, <em>Shirley</em>, but her new literary success was soon
                        overshadowed by family tragedy. Within a year, all three of her
                        remaining siblings were dead. Branwell&rsquo;s health had been declining steadily,
                        weakened by alcoholism and addiction to opiates. His grandiose expectations
                        of artistic or literary fame never came to fruition. Branwell died of chronic bronchitis in
                            September 1848, at age thirty-one. Charlotte grieved as much for
                        Branwell&rsquo;s wasted life as she did for his death.</p>
<p class="">mily caught a cold on the
                            day of Branwell&rsquo;s funeral. She grew steadily weaker, refusing to consult
                            a doctor, despite Charlotte&rsquo;s urging.
                        She died in December 1848, of
                            pulmonary tuberculosis, at age thirty.
                        Anne also displaying
                            symptoms of tuberculosis, Charlotte rushed her to the seaside in an
                            attempt to help her recover, but Anne died in May 1849, aged twenty-nine.</p>
<p class="">The
                        sole surviving Bront&euml; sibling, Charlotte was bereft of her imaginative and
                        literary support. Lonely and desolate, Charlotte still managed to
                        finish <em>Shirley</em> by the end of August 1849. It was
                        published in October by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. <em></em><em>Shirley</em> was not as successful as <em>Jane Eyre</em>, but nevertheless, it did address important social
                        issues of the day. This novel was Charlotte&rsquo;s attempt to address the
                        &ldquo;condition of women&rdquo; issue, as well as the class conflicts of
                        industrialization. Avoiding the topics that had aroused such scandal with
                            <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Charlotte declared that <em>Shirley</em> would be &ldquo;as unromantic as Monday morning&rdquo;
                        (ODNB). This foray into strict realism did not produce Bront&euml;&rsquo;s most
                        powerful work, but <em>Shirley</em> is still an ambitious and
                        masterful novel.</p>
<p class="">While Charlotte kept her identity a secret from the public, for the time
                        being, she was curious to meet the literary celebrities of London, and asked George Smith to
                        introduce her to some of them when she stayed with him and his mother in
                        1849 and 1850. There she met such prominent writers as Thackeray and Lewes,
                        who noted her shyness and her lack beauty. Charlotte had
                        always been self-conscious about her unimpressive physicality, and it seems
                        these encounters caused her more uneasiness than pleasure. She also met Elizabeth Gaskell on a trip to Edinburgh in 1850. Gaskell was a
                        novelist who would become Charlotte&rsquo;s friend and confidant, and later, her
                        first biographer.</p>
<p class="">The criticism she had received for <em>Jane Eyre</em> still
                        rankled, however, and now that her sisters were dead, there was no longer as
                        much reason for concealing the sisters&rsquo; true identity. (Emily had been the
                        most fiercely protective of her privacy.) Charlotte decided to clear her
                        reputation, as well as her sisters&rsquo;. She issued a second edition of <em>Agnes Grey</em> and <em>Wuthering
                            Heights</em> (this time published by Smith, Elder &amp; Co.) with a
                        &ldquo;Biographical Notice&rdquo; appended to it, in which she revealed her sisters&rsquo;
                        true identity and defended their work. However, the defensive tone that she
                        adopts is also curiously apologetic, and seems to infantilize Emily and
                        Anne. Charlotte protests that her sisters were merely ignorant Yorkshire
                        girls who didn&rsquo;t know any better, and didn&rsquo;t mean to offend. She describes
                        Haworth as a &ldquo;remote district where education had made little progress&rdquo;
                        (Miller, 28), urging this in extenuation of her sisters&rsquo; errors. This
                        depiction was certainly an act of misrepresentation, albeit sincerely meant.
                        In the introduction to her seminal biography of the Bront&euml;s, Juliet Barker
                        describes how she trawled through the archives of local newspapers published
                        in the time of the Bront&euml;s, unearthing a large amount of information that
                        controverts "the
                            myth that Haworth was a remote and obscure village where nothing ever
                            happened. It was a township, a small, industrial town in the heart of a
                            much larger chapelry, where politics and religion were hotly disputed
                            and culture thrived&rdquo; (Barker, xix).</p>
<p class="">However, if the view of Haworth
                            Parsonage as a completely isolated landmark in the midst of
                            unadulterated moorland is a popular myth, as both Miller and Barker
                        observe, it is a myth that is partly of Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s own making. This
                        myth was embellished by Elizabeth Gaskell in her famous <em>Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;</em>, which attempted to portray Charlotte as
                        a dutiful, self-denying woman&mdash;sanitizing anything controversial in her works
                        or papers. Gaskell discusses Bront&euml;&rsquo;s career as an author in gendered terms,
                        seeing the role of author and the role of woman as competing for first place
                        in Charlotte&rsquo;s priorities. Gaskell emphasizes her belief that for Charlotte,
                        the duties of womanhood always came first. &ldquo;When a man becomes an author,&rdquo;
                        writes Gaskell, &ldquo;it is probably merely a change of employment to
                        him&hellip;[another] steps into his vacant place, and probably does as well as he.&rdquo;
                        For a woman, however, cannot shirk her domestic responsibilities to pursue a
                        career:</p>
<p class="block">But
                            no other can take up the quiet regular duties of the daughter, the wife,
                            or the mother, as well as she whom God has appointed to fill that
                            particular place: a woman&rsquo;s principal work in life is hardly left to her
                            own choice; nor can she drop the domestic charges devolving on her as an
                            individual, for the exercise of the most splendid talents that were ever
                            bestowed. (Gaskell, 271-272)</p>
<p class="">Gaskell was obviously at pains to prove to the world that Charlotte did not
                        neglect her &ldquo;principal work&rdquo; as a woman in order to exercise her talents,
                        that she was a dutiful daughter and sister, without unfeminine ambitions. As
                        Gaskell&rsquo;s biography was commissioned by Patrick Bront&euml; to fight the &ldquo;misrepresentations&rdquo; that had sullied
                        his daughter&rsquo;s image, such an idealized portrayal of Charlotte is hardly
                        surprising (Miller, 64). Gaskell&rsquo;s portrayal continued to influence popular
                        and scholarly conceptions of Charlotte&rsquo;s life, and it is only recently that
                        the larger picture has begun to be pieced together.</p>
<p class="">In her last completed novel, <em>Villette</em>, Charlotte
                        reworked the material she had previously used in <em>The
                            Professor</em>, again drawing on her experiences in Brussels and her
                        unrequited love for Constantin Heger. In <em>Villette</em>,
                        Charlotte returned to the first-person female narrator, this time the
                        character Lucy Snowe, who travels to Villette, an imaginary version of
                        Brussels, to teach in a girls&rsquo; school. Lucy is in some ways a more complex,
                        although less likeable, narrator than Jane Eyre. Her paranoia and secrecy
                        lead her to conceal information, even from the reader. <em>Villette</em> contains the promise of fulfillment in love, but the
                        ending remains ambiguous.</p>
<p class="">Published in January 1843, <em>Villette</em> met with mixed
                        reviews. Thackeray characteristically attributed the heroine&rsquo;s longing for
                        love to the author herself. &ldquo;Poor little woman of genius!&rdquo; he wrote to a
                        friend, &ldquo;She wants some Tomkins or another to love her and be in love with.
                        But you see she is a little bit of a creature without a pennyworth of good
                        looks&hellip;and no Tomkins will come&rdquo; (Maynard, 15). Like Gaskell, Thackeray
                        implies that women can gain true fulfillment only in conventional
                        domesticity; literary achievement is a sort of consolation prize.</p>
<p class="">Ironically, Charlotte would soon after achieve the kind of domestic happiness
                        from which Thackeray thought she was permanently excluded. Her father&rsquo;s
                        curate, Arthur Bell Nicholls,
                        declared his attachment to Charlotte. Although Patrick Bront&euml; initially disapproved of the match,
                        Charlotte and Arthur were married in Haworth Church on June 29, 1854. They
                        spent their honeymoon in Ireland, and then returned to Haworth to care for
                        Charlotte&rsquo;s aging father.</p>
<p class="">Charlotte&rsquo;s letters reveal that it was a happy marriage, but sadly, her new
                        happiness was short-lived. In the early stages of pregnancy, Charlotte was
                        weakened by morning sickness, caught a chill, and died on March 31, 1855. She had been
                        married less than a year. At her death, Charlotte left the manuscript of her
                        last novel <em>Emma</em> unfinished. </p>
