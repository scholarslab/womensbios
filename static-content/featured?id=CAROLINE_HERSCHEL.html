<p class="" id="N16824_p">Caroline Herschel&rsquo;s father, Isaac Herschel, was the son of a
                        landscape-gardener to the King of Saxony. Rather than following in his
                        father&rsquo;s footsteps Isaac pursued his passion for music, becoming an oboe
                        player in the Royal Hanoverian Band in 1731 at the age of twenty-four. The
                        next year he and Anna Ilse Moritzen
                        were married; and her very traditionally-minded family background,
                        especially concerning the role of women, would later have an impact on their
                        daughters. The Herschels' still-growing family was disrupted in 1743 by the
                            Battle of Dettingen,
                        in which Isaac fought, and from which he returned with an acute rheumatism which
                            would weigh on his health for the remaining years of his life. Two
                        years later, however, Caroline Lucretia was born in Hanover&mdash;the fourth of six children.

<p class="" id="N16824_p">Caroline Herschel&rsquo;s father, Isaac Herschel, was the son of a

                        in which Isaac fought, and from which he returned with an acute rheumatism which
                            would weigh on his health for the remaining years of his life. Two
                        years later, however, Caroline Lucretia was born in Hanover&mdash;the fourth of six children.
                    </p>
<p class="">All the children, except the eldest daughter Sophia Elizabeth, very early exhibited distinct
                            musical
                        talent, but Caroline's gifts in that direction were almost entirely
                        neglected&mdash;writing and reading being, in her mother's estimation, the only
                        necessary accomplishments for a woman. During her father's lifetime he
                        supplied her with occasional lessons on the violin, and to him may be traced
                        the musical and scientific tastes which distinguished his children. When
                        asthma and rheumatism finally necessitated his retirement from the army in
                        1760, it was his great delight to discuss musical and scientific matters
                        with them; but after his death in 1762 Caroline was entirely relegated to the kitchen, and
                            to the manifold duties which accrue to a servantless household.</p>
<p class="">But Caroline Herschel never
                            thought of herself; she had a "royal instinct for serving others," and
                            to be useful in the narrow sphere of a modest German home was as much a
                            religion to her as was afterwards the loving service which she devoted
                            to her brother in England.</p>
<p class="">Entirely devoid of
                            self-consciousness, with an hereditary spirit of discipline running in
                            her veins, united with an instinctive love of self-sacrifice for the
                            sake of duty, there is a nobility and a "divine enthusiasm" about
                            Caroline Herschel which invests all her deeds with an enduring grandeur
                            which she herself would have sincerely deprecated.
                    </p>
<p class="">For many years the daily routine of cleaning and cooking and knitting went
                        on, but at last the relief
                            came, in the shape of a request that was almost a command, from her
                            beloved brother William, that
                            she should go back with him to England, where he had been promoted from Halifax parish church
                            to the post of Organist to the Octagon Chapel at Bath, then recently consecrated. In August 1772, at the age of
                                twenty-seven, Caroline landed on English shores at
                            Harwich.</p>
<p class="">&hellip;At the time of her arrival in England she could only read and write, so we
                        may well believe that it was with mingled delight and diffidence that she
                        entered upon her new life at Bath. From being a maid-of-all-work in Hanover
                        to being the coadjutor of a man like William Herschel was indeed a change which our imagination
                        "boggles at"; and had she been a woman of less heroic
                            mould, she might have given herself up to alternate moods of
                        exaltation and despair, without our feeling any reasonable wonder. </p>
<p class="">But Caroline was made of true Teutonic stuff, and this was soon made manifest
                        in her everyday life with the "Hanoverian fiddler" whose scientific
                        discoveries and deductions subsequently electrified the whole civilised
                        world. Seven years his junior, disliking publicity, and a "hausfrau" bred if
                        not born, it is simply amazing to watch the loyalty and devotion with which
                        she followed and smoothed every step of the path which her brother elected
                        to pursue. </p>
<p class="">Strait was the gate and narrow was the
                            way, but no stumbling-block was allowed to interfere, no difficulties
                            discouraged. An innate spirit of obedience enabled her to perform what
                            seem almost like miracles; and the young woman whose acquirements would
                            now be sneered at by many a girl in her teens, was thereby made capable
                            of carrying through schemes, both musical and scientific, which at first
                            sight must have seemed well-nigh impossible, had such a word ever
                        occurred to her in connection with any of her brother's desires or designs. </p>
<p class="">On Sundays she received her weekly housekeeping money, accompanied in early
                        days with due directions as to "debit" and "credit"; and, after six weeks in
                        England, she was trusted to go marketing alone, though her brother
                        Alexander, then in England as well, generally hovered at no great distance,
                        in case she should find any insuperable difficulty in making known her
                        requirements. </p>
<p class="">William was now making a considerable income by concerts, compositions,
                        teaching, and organ-playing, and for a time her attention was principally
                        devoted to making herself of service to him in the musical world. </p>
<p class="">By diligent practising, she made herself equal to performing in oratorios and
                        concerts with no inconsiderable success, the only stipulation which she
                        ventured to make being that, only when William was conducting should she be
                        asked to do so. The marvellous activity of those first ten years may be
                        guessed from the fact that William Herschel was giving from thirty-five to
                        thirty-eight music lessons every week, and that during this time Caroline
                        persevered in her novel duties&mdash;practising, performing, and copying scores,
                        just as directed by the beloved brother. She saw and heard nothing save
                        through him; but it is evident that, had self-aggrandisement been ever in
                        her thoughts, she might have made for herself a permanent position in the
                        musical world. For, incredible as
                            it may appear, she was soon counted worthy, even by such stern critics
                            as her own brothers, to take the part of leading treble in oratorios;
                            and the fashionable leaders of Bath society were loud in their praises
                            of her voice and manner. This admiration, however, was not
                        reciprocated, and, in her blunt German fashion, she denounced  the
                            ordinary young ladies as "very little better than idiots."
                    </p>
<p class="">But the poor little prima-donna housekeeper had by no means exhausted her
                        duties when she returned weary and jaded from a long evening of
                        responsibility and exertion in the crowded concert-rooms of Bristol or Bath.
                        Music to William was but a means to an end, and that end was Astronomy.
                        Unconscious of fatigue himself, he seems to have lost all count of time when
                        bent upon solving some of the mighty mysteries of infinite space; and his
                        sister's aid was found invaluable. He had tested his brothers, but had found
                        them wanting; and her obedient zeal in helping forward all his schemes made
                        him realise that here, at last, was one upon whose deftness, adaptability, and strenuous help he could
                            confidently depend. Night after night for eight years they worked
                        together&mdash;calculating, measuring, mirror-grinding, examining, writing
                        memoranda,&mdash;and not until daylight had chased away the stars did she allow
                        herself to be tired. </p>
<p class="">Never was a man of science so favoured in his assistant. Alexander, though
                        both musical and mechanical, had no perseverance; and, while his 'cello
                        solos were "divine," he lacked the steady fixedness of purpose which would
                        have raised him to the first rank of public performers. It was Caroline,
                        therefore, on whom William relied for help in the construction of tools, for
                        grinding and polishing. "Logarithms made easy" is a book which has yet to be
                        written; but with these also Caroline had to be conversant, as well as with
                        mathematical problems of which her ready brain had to assimilate the
                        working, while her tiny hands dispensed the frugal meals. Sometimes William used
                            laughingly to make her forego part of her dinner if she could not
                            describe the angle of the piece of pudding which she was cutting. She it
                            was who fashioned the pasteboard model of the tube to hold the first
                            large telescope, and her dexterous fingers and eager longing to be of
                            service made her&mdash;as, with a touchingly proud modesty, she herself
                        expresses it&mdash;"almost
                            as useful as a boy."
                    </p>
<p class="">At one stage of fashioning a reflector it is necessary for the workman to
                        remain for many hours with his hands on the mirror. On one occasion
                            William never stirred for sixteen hours, his sister meanwhile feeding
                            him and reading to him, ready at any minute to obey his slightest
                            wish. At such times as these she read aloud the novels of Sterne
                        and Fielding, and the gorgeous stories of 'The Arabian Nights'; but the
                        fairy tales of science were all their own, and we can fancy that silence
                        would often fall between them as they speculated upon the wonder-lands of
                        the moon with its flame-breathing craters, the mazy labyrinths of the "Milky
                        Way," or the faithful satellites of Saturn. </p>
<p class="">And she never failed him. In all his work she was his veritable "alter ego."
                        In winter nights, when the ink froze upon her pen, she still was by his
                        side&mdash;in garden or in garret&mdash;helping him to do work which, without her, would
                        have been well-nigh impossible. As in music so in astronomy- her one idea
                        was, "All I am, all I
                            know, I owe to him. I did nothing for my brother but what a well-trained
                            puppy-dog would have done: that is to say, I did what he commanded me. I
                            was a mere tool, which he had the trouble of sharpening." Here,
                        between the lines, we can read the faint, underlying bitterness with which
                        she looked back upon her neglected education. In a note to her nephew
                        (afterwards Sir John Herschel) she says, "My only reason for saying so much of myself is to
                            show with what miserable assistance your father made shift to obtaining
                            the means of exploring the heavens." This was her own
                        self-estimate; ours is far different, and so we are convinced was his
                        also. He might have discovered scores of planets; but, had he not
                        appreciated her skilful help, he would nevertheless have been a contemptible
                        cur. </p>
<p class="">For some years they lived at 7 New King Street, but for the sake of better
                        accommodation in 1779 they removed to No. 19, where, on the 13th of March
                        1781, William discovered the planet Uranus. </p>
<p class="">In spite of the most careful frugality, all this while they had still found
                        it impossible to give up the earnings derived from music; but the time was
                        nigh, even at the door, when organ and oboe should be put aside, and when
                        science, the first love of William Herschel's life, should reign preeminent
                        over the lives of both brother and sister. They made their last public
                        appearance together, on the Whit-Sunday of 1782 at St Margaret's Chapel,
                        Bath,&mdash;the anthem, in which Caroline sang, being composed and conducted by
                        William himself. </p>
<p class="">Henceforward, astronomy was their
                            only care and study; though, when her allotted threescore years and
                        ten were long past, Caroline was constantly to be seen at the concerts in
                        Hanover, and the "little old lady" was a familiar figure in the stalls of
                        the opera-house. </p>
<p class="">It was in August 1782 that, through the influence of His Majesty George
                            II., the Herschels left Bath for Datchet, William having been created
                            Astronomer-Royal, with a salary of &pound;200 per annum. It was a post
                        that brought with it more honour than honoraria; but money with the
                        Herschels had never been plentiful, and the deceitfulness of riches was to
                        them an unknown danger. They cheerfully determined to live upon eggs and
                        bacon, and set to work upon the construction of that wonderful 40-foot telescope
                        which swept the heavens with such unthought-of results. Recognising her share in its
                            construction with gratitude and astonishment, we see in it a monument of
                            unremitting industry and endurance, such as dwarfs all other
                            astronomical instruments into insignificance, and her woman's wit
                            doubtless supplied suggestions as to ways and means, and expedients
                            which would not have occurred to the less practical mind of her brother.
                            Hers is not a solitary instance of deliberate self-effacement, but the
                            world will never know how much more than the mere discovery of eight
                            comets was due to the tireless energy and unselfish adaptability of
                            Caroline Herschel&hellip;.</p>
<p class="">
                        One winter's night, when the
                            snow lay a foot deep upon the ground, they were examining stars outside
                            the house. She was hurrying to a little distance from the telescope to
                            make some special observation when she fell heavily upon an unseen
                            butcher's hook, which penetrated deeply into her leg. "Make haste,
                            Caroline," came his voice across the dark whiteness. "I can't, William,
                            I'm hooked," was the feeble answer; and when, with much difficulty, the
                            bleeding limb was extricated, nearly two ounces of flesh had to be left
                            behind. Even then her only thought was of him, and her only comfort amid
                            the pain was that, as clouds were coming up rapidly, she had not
                            materially hindered his night's work.
                    </p>
<p class="">The Datchet landlady proved herself a failure, and Clay Hill, Windsor, their
                        next abode, was insufferably damp, so that in April 1786 they again had to
                        move themselves and their weighty belongings&mdash;no slight consideration&mdash;and at
                        last got comfortably settled in Slough. The king now gave to William
                        Herschel a further grant, in order to enable him to prosecute his scientific
                        labours unhampered by pecuniary anxiety, and, as Astronomer-Royal, he was
                        frequently summoned to London. Many of Caroline's observations were now made
                        in solitude. Alone, in
                            the cold star-lit nights, the sweeping of the heavens was not an unmixed
                            pleasure, though the discovery of "the first lady's comet," which
                        so much interested Fanny Burney, must have been a really
                        delightful experience. When she found herself invested with the dignity of a discoverer she
                            surely must have realised, if only for the first time, that she was
                            neither a tool nor a fool. In reply to her modest announcement, we
                        find the famous scientist Alexander Aubert writing&mdash;</p>
<p class="block">
                        "You have
                            immortalised your name, and you deserve such a reward from the Being who
                            has ordered all these things to move as we find them, for your assiduity
                            in the business of Astronomy, and for your love for so celebrated and so
                            deserving a brother."
                    </p>
<p class="">A salary of &pound;50 per annum was now granted her as "assistant" to the
                        Astronomer- Royal, and in 1787 she received "the first money that ever in all my life I thought
                            I could spend as I liked."
                    </p>
<p class="">We find from another entry in
                            her Diary that she had been accustomed to put down her little personal
                            expenses in her brother's account-book as "for Car."; but that, since
                            leaving Bath, they had never exceeded &pound;8 per annum.
                        Such
                        a statement is too touching in its simple honesty to need comment; but in these days, when
                            the papers think it worth while to discuss the question as to whether
                            &pound;100 per annum is a niggardly dress allowance, we can but admire,
                        and wonder, and adore! </p>
<p class="">The Herschels received at their
                            home many aristocrats and other distinguished persons desiring to see
                            their telescope and to make the acquaintance of the Royal astronomers,
                            among whom were the Prince of Orange and the Princesse de Lamballe.
                    </p>
<p class="">But the happy days of
                            solitude &agrave; deux, as the French prettily call it, were now drawing to a
                            close, and it was another woman's hand that was destined for many a long
                            day to darken the happiness of the devoted little sister.
                    </p>
<p class="">On the 8th of May
                            1788 William Herschel married Mary, only child of James Baldwin,
                        and widow of Mr John Pitt. </p>
<p class="">For sixteen years Caroline had devoted herself to him with an identity of
                        interest and a supreme self-sacrifice, unique even
                            among the histories of unselfish women; and we can almost see the
                        tear-dimmed eyes and quivering fingers with which she made the last entry in
                        her Journal of that year,  "I gave up my place as housekeeper."
                        </p>
<p class="">We cannot doubt that expostulations ensued, and that propositions were made
                        that she should continue to live at Collingwood; but she was no longer
                        needed&mdash;there lay the sting. Through evil report and good report she had
                        never thought but of him, and now another was to enter into her kingdom.
                        That the bride was gentle and amiable, and that she brought with her a
                        jointure which enabled her husband to experiment still more unfetteredly,
                        did not make the blow any less hard for Caroline to bear; and, in the
                        destruction of all her personal papers from 1788 to 1798, we can see plainly
                        that she thought it best to destroy what in the very anguish of her soul she
                        had written. In after years she learned to love and esteem her
                        sister-in-law, for her own sake as well as for the sake of him whom both
                        loved so dearly. </p>
<p class="">"I gave up my place as
                        housekeeper"&mdash;the sorrowful undertone is in every word of the brief entry&mdash;but
                        she reserved to herself the right of access at all times to the roof of her
                        brother's house, the observatory, and the workroom. Hither she came daily, returning
                            for her meals to the Spratt m&eacute;nage. When the family were away she used
                            to go and stay in the house, looking after the interests of him whom she
                            loved so well; but there is a profound melancholy in an entry in
                        her Journal made on one of these occasions, "All came home; and I went to my
                        solitude again." </p>
<p class="">Her "Book of work done" shows no decrease of mental or physical activity, but
                        the contrast between her own small lodging and the happy home-life so near,
                        from which, rightly or wrongly, she felt herself debarred, must often have
                        been very bitter. Within a stone's-throw was all that she most cared for,
                        brother and nephew&mdash;the little John Herschel, born in 1792, who
                        in after years inherited the love which she had lavished upon his father,
                        and the genius which enabled him to sweep the southern hemisphere, from his
                        observatory at Feldhausen, with the same earnest assiduity which had
                        characterised his father and his aunt in their northern surveys. </p>
<p class="">Of this South African Expedition she exclaimed in her vigorous Anglo-German,
                            "Ja, if I was
                            thirty or forty years younger and could go too! In Gottes Namen!"
                    </p>
<p class="">"Bills and receipts for my Comets" is the quaint way in which she docketed
                        her memoranda relative to these erratic phenomena, for five of which, at
                        least, she could claim undisputed priority of discovery. The most laborious
                        of her undertakings, however, was a catalogue of all the star-clusters and
                        nebulae observed by her brother, and it was for this that the gold medal of
                            the Royal Astronomical Society was voted to her in 1828, followed by the
                            extraordinary distinction of an honorary membership. This catalogue
                        was the outcome of many years of labour, but it was a labour of love, as
                        being the corner-stone in the temple of his fame. </p>
<p class="">The Royal Family showed much attention to the clever Herschels, and there are
                        several entries in her Diary as to days at Frogmore and dinners with the
                        Queen. </p>
<p class="">She was under some anxiety
                            at this time as to her eyes, but the oculist having reassured her, she
                            continued her work with unabated interest. Her constitution must have
                            been extraordinarily good, for though the strain upon it for many years
                            must have been excessive, she never spent a day in bed from 1761 to
                            1821.
                        She is but another
                            illustration of the truth of Bacon's aphorism&mdash;"One of the rewards of
                            philosophy is long life." That her brother should die before her
                        does not seem to have entered into her calculations, and, with a view to her
                        death, she made all arrangements for simplifying matters for her survivors;
                        but the love of living was still strong in Caroline when,  in 1822, the tie of more
                            than fifty years was for ever broken, and William Herschel, full of age,
                            wisdom and honour, saw the sun set for the last time on earth, and woke
                            to find himself beyond the stars. It was when stupefied with grief that
                            Caroline took the fatal step of making over herself and all her little
                            capital to the care of her younger brother, Dietrich. What was at
                        the root of her action we can only guess. Possibly she had some sort of
                        craving to take up once more a place in the home of her childhood, and hoped
                        to bury her sorrow in associations that would be both old and new&hellip;.</p>
<p class="">"A few books and my sweeper" is the pathetically brief inventory of her
                        possessions at this time; and her only capital, &pound;500&mdash;the savings of fifty
                        years of toil&mdash;she transferred to Dietrich, thus giving herself no possibility of retracting her
                        determination of leaving England for ever and settling in Hanover with him. Little did she
                            expect that twenty-five years more of life would be given her, in
                        which to chafe against the narrow interests of that small German town. After
                        the width and wisdom which she had enjoyed in "happy England" the monotonous
                        flatness of her life was almost unbearable. Her nephew's advice had been all
                        against her going, and deeply did she regret her hasty action, as the long
                        years passed uneventfully by. But she had "burned her boats," and retreat
                        was impossible. Dietrich, who knew his own inferiority, despised the sister
                        whose perspicacity had not been equal to seeing it also. She made up her mind
                        to endure, thinking that she must soon die; but Death&mdash;who claims so many
                        unwilling followers&mdash;seemed to have forgotten her, and home-sick, lonely, and
                        sad, she rusted there for another quarter of a century. Her books and
                        telescope she sent back to England shortly after her arrival in Hanover, as
                        she soon had reason to fear that Dietrich's extravagant habits might induce
                        him to sell them after her death&hellip;.</p>
<p class="">Till 1827 she lived with, and nursed, this fractious and ill-conditioned
                        mortal&mdash;of whom she says, "I hardly ever knew a man of his age
                            labouring under more infirmities, nor bearing them with less
                            patience." Then her patience and his impatience alike ended, and he
                        went to his own place&hellip;.</p>
<p class="">After Dietrich's death she removed to 376 Braunschweiger Strasse, where, with
                        her confidential servant Betty, she lived for fifteen years in an eventide
                        that had in it some faint after-glow of the days that were gone. </p>
<p class="">The sparseness of her belongings seems to have been a source of amusement to
                        her rather than of chagrin, as witness the following items in her household
                            inventory:&mdash; </p>
<p class="block">
                        "Plate.
                            Ha! ha! ha! ha! 
                    </p>
<p class="block">
                        "Requisites for self and servant, mostly bought at fairs. 
                    </p>
<p class="block">
                        "Cane-bottomed chairs, each valued at eighteen-pence" (of which she
                            says proudly, "after seven years' use, like new").
                    </p>
<p class="block">
                        "About
                            fifty books, and a few tea-things."
                    </p>
<p class="">
                        At the age of eighty-eight,
                            in one of her merry moods, she put her foot behind her back, and
                            scratched her ear with it! This astounding acrobatic feat beats the
                            record as far as we are aware! But apparently it created no great
                            surprise, for Sir John Herschel says of her only a year or two earlier,
                            "In the morning she is dull and weary, but as the day advances she gains
                            life, and is quite fresh and funny at 10 P.M., and sings hymns, nay,
                            even dances, to the great delight of all who see her." 
                    </p>
<p class="">In 1846, Alexander von Humboldt
                            conveyed to her the Prussian Gold Medal for Science. It was a tardy
                            recognition from the King of Prussia, but we can fancy that it gave
                            enormous pleasure both to the envoy and the recipient&hellip;</p>
<p class="">Within four days of her death, in reply to General Halkett's message that he
                        hoped soon to come and give her a kiss, as he had done on her ninety-seventh
                        birthday, the dear old lady looked up quite saucily and said,  "Tell the General
                            that I have not tasted anything since that I liked so well."</p>
<p class="">
                        Her characteristic
                            fortitude never forsook her, but at last she "fell asleep," and on the
                            9th of January 1848 she joined her brother in that land where no sun, no
                            moon appeareth, where no shadow ever falls.
                    </p>
<p class="">In the old
                        garrison church where she had been baptised ninety-seven years before, the
                        burial service was read over the body of Caroline Lucretia Herschel.
                        Garlands of laurel and cypress covered the coffin, and within it, at her
                        express desire, were buried with her a lock of her brother William's hair,
                        and an old almanac which had belonged to her father.</p>
