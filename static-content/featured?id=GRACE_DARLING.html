                        and abroad.</p>
<p class="">Grace Horsley Darling was born in Bamburgh, Northumberland on November 14, 1815, and was the
                        seventh of William and Thomasin Darling&rsquo;s nine
                        children. William Darling was a lighthouse keeper, as his
                        father had been before him, and Grace
                        and her siblings grew up on the &ldquo;Longstone Light on one of the wild and
                        savage Farne islands&rdquo;
                            (Sitwell 59). Relatively little is known regarding Grace&rsquo;s early years, though she seems to
                        have received a solid education evident in her handwriting, which was &ldquo;equal
                        to that of most ladies&rdquo; (Bruce 376). Furthermore, she was
                        surrounded by books, albeit those &ldquo;principally [of] Divinity&rdquo; and
                        &ldquo;Geography, History, Voyages and Travels, with Maps&rdquo; (Mitford
                        89). Her father regarded novels and other forms of literature, as well as
                        pursuits such as card-playing, to be the works of the Devil, and raised his
                        family within the confines of strict Puritanism (Mitford 89;
                        ODNB ). </p>
<p class="">In their remote location, Grace and her
                        family were isolated from society at large, making only occasional
                        excursions to the mainland, and otherwise occupying themselves with the
                        daily domestic duties of the lighthouse (Bruce). Perhaps as a
                        result of this confined but (for Grace,
                        apparently) enjoyable upbringing, Grace
                        was &ldquo;remarkable for a retiring and somewhat reserved disposition&rdquo;
                            (Bruce 376). She assisted her father in his work on the
                        lighthouse and kept watch at times (ODNB), bearing witness to several wrecks
                        and rescues over the course of her lifetime but never participating in them,
                        as her older brothers were always present to help their father
                            (Bruce). </p>
<p class="">In this manner, for the first twenty-two years of her life, the mild-tempered
                        &ldquo;young girl of five feet two, with small wrists&rdquo; (Sitwell 61)
                        lived quietly in a household of sober industry and religious commitment. The
                        events of the early hours of September 7, 1838, however,
                        drastically expanded the confined world in which Grace lived, though they never seemed to
                        change her fundamental personality and temperament.</p>
<p class="">The Forfarshire, one of the largest steamships of its day, set off from port
                        on September 6, 1838, carrying around sixty people, crew and
                        passengers. Upon encountering a brutal storm near the Farne Islands, the ship was wrecked on Big Harcar
                        Rock (Mitford 29). Grace,
                        keeping watch from the lighthouse, glimpsed the nine survivors at around
                        five o&rsquo;clock on the morning of September 7 and informed her
                        father (Thomasin Darling). Her older brothers had all left
                        their parents by then to live on the mainland, while her younger brother,
                        who was usually present at the lighthouse, was away on a fishing excursion
                            (Mitford 29). As a result, Grace was put in the unusual position of being the only
                        able-bodied assistant for her father. Most initial accounts of the story of
                        this day portray William Darling as reluctant and unwilling to
                        brave the stormy waters, while Grace
                        forced him into action by declaring her intention to go regardless of his
                        participation (Sitwell). Later accounts, however, have
                        questioned this depiction of the story, and the only firsthand written
                        account of the rescue is that of William Darling himself, in
                        the official letter he wrote to the Secretary of Trinity House. </p>
<p class="">His depiction of the rescue is a straightforward factual representation in
                        which he credits his &ldquo;Daughter&rdquo; with having &ldquo;observed a vessel on Harker&rsquo;s
                        Rock&rdquo; and &ldquo;incessantly [applying] the glass until near 7 o&rsquo;clock when, the
                        tide being fallen [they] observed three or four men upon the rock.&rdquo; He then
                        states that they &ldquo;agreed that if [they] could get to them some of them would
                        be able to assist [them] back,&rdquo; after which they &ldquo;immediately launched
                        [their] boat, and [were] enabled to gain the rock.&rdquo; Grace and William then
                        returned to the Lighthouse with the sole woman and four of the men, two of
                        whom then returned with William to retrieve the remaining four
                        men (William Darling). The matter-of-fact attitude with which
                        these events were treated by the Darling family is evident in
                            William Darling&rsquo;s account of the rescue. To a family of
                        lighthouse-keepers, dangerous rescues were fairly frequent occurrences, and
                        the efforts that Grace and her father
                        put forth were expected and unremarkable. Indeed, William Darling is likely
                        to have thought of the prospect of "sole salvage rights" to the goods in the
                        wreck if he could reach the ship (ODNB). The rest of the nation, however,
                        did not perceive the event in such a pragmatic manner. Instead, the public
                        exalted the romantic and heroic nature of the event in a manner directly
                        opposed to the down-to-earth humility of the Darlings&rsquo;
                        reaction.</p>
<p class="">The year 1838, one
                        year following the beginning of <a href="featured%3Fid=QUEEN_VICTORIA.html">Queen
                            Victoria&rsquo;s</a> reign and its corresponding era, was a &ldquo;moment [that]
                        was opportune for acclaiming female virtue&rdquo; (Correspondent). Although Grace and her father played equally
                        significant roles in the rescue of the survivors, it was Grace and the combination of her
                        unconventional physical feat and virtuous humility, emblematic of ideal
                        Victorian womanhood, that attracted the media and publicity. The number of
                        visitors at the Longstone Lighthouse increased exponentially as people from
                        all over the country flocked to meet the great heroine and see the location
                        of her selfless deed.</p>
<p class="">In addition to the masses that besieged the once reclusive world of Longstone
                        Lighthouse, numerous institutions celebrated the Darling
                        family. The Royal Humane Society acknowledged Grace and William Darling in a special general
                        court held on October 31, 1838 that highlighted the
                        &ldquo;intrepidity, presence of mind, and humanity that nobly urged
                            [Grace]&rdquo; to rescue the survivors of the shipwreck
                            (Thomasin Darling 26). In addition to this acknowledgment,
                            Grace and William each
                        received the society&rsquo;s Golden Medallion, one of the highest honors of that
                        time. The Duke of Northumberland was
                        chosen to deliver the honorific medallions, and he added to the delivery his
                        own gifts for the family: waterproof clothing, a silver teapot, a gold seal
                        engraved with Grace&rsquo;s initials, and
                        four pounds of tea. It was through this act of largesse that the lifelong
                        friendship between the Duke and Grace
                        began (Thomasin Darling).</p>
<p class="">Following the Royal Humane Society&rsquo;s lead, many other national and local
                        institutions recognized Grace&rsquo;s
                        actions. She received medals from The Royal Institution for the Preservation
                        of Life from Shipwreck, The Edinburgh and
                            Leith Humane Society, The Glasgow Humane Society, and The Shipwreck
                        Society of Newcastle. Some organizations,
                        such as Lloyds, the insurance company, and The Ladies of Edinburgh, chose to send money and stocks to Grace and her father. Just a year after
                        the shipwreck, Grace had received about
                        seven hundred and fifty pounds' worth of stock (Thomasin
                            Darling). </p>
<p class="">Medals, stocks, and money were not the only gifts that Grace and her family received. Admirers
                        sent a plethora of treasures that included silver tea sets, jewelry, and
                        even a beaver bonnet. The number of presents received by the family, despite
                        its immensity, was insignificant in comparison to the number of letters sent
                        to the lighthouse. Many people wrote simply to praise Grace, demonstrating the public
                        fascination surrounding her. Others wrote to describe how they had lost
                        loved ones in shipwrecks and to thank Grace for preventing others from suffering the same loss. <a href="featured%3Fid=QUEEN_VICTORIA.html">Queen Victoria</a> herself recognized and
                        contributed to Grace&rsquo;s national
                        prominence when the Darlings received a letter from the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Treasury stating that
                        &ldquo;Her Majesty [had] been called to the circumstances attending the Wreck of
                        the Forfarshire Steamer&rdquo; and wished to acknowledge Grace Darling for her actions in saving
                        the survivors (Thomasin Darling 30). Amongst all of these
                        letters, however, there is no evidence that Grace ever received acknowledgement from the survivors of the
                        Forfarshire&rsquo;s wreck (Thomasin Darling).</p>
<p class="">Grace attempted to reply to every letter
                        and gift she received. She usually declined any admiration or gratitude,
                        insisting that she was simply God&rsquo;s instrument, and that therefore it was
                        God who deserved the thanks. Many people wrote to Grace asking for a signature or lock of
                        her hair, leading her to begin enclosing locks of hair in her responses as a
                        means of repayment for the recognition she received (Thomasin
                            Darling). This custom soon ended, however, as Grace &ldquo;would soon have been left with a
                        closely cropped head&rdquo; had her attempts to satisfy the demanding public
                        continued in this manner (Thomasin Darling 47).</p>
<p class="">Despite this sudden burst of popularity and fame, Grace &ldquo;shrank from, not courted, the
                        public&rdquo; (Thomasin Darling 38), behavior that simultaneously
                        reinforced the Victorian conception of her virtuous nature and characterized
                        her as a shy and wild creature threatened by the hungry public
                            (Sitwell). Grace
                        received many offers to be properly introduced to London&rsquo;s society, some including paid appearances, but
                        she refused all of them. The Duke of Northumberland, now a family friend and patron, understood Grace&rsquo;s reluctance to embrace her fame
                        and worked to spare her from undesired exhibition. When Grace received letters requesting her
                        appearance at various ceremonies and functions, she informed the Duke and he
                        wrote politely worded refusals on her behalf. Eventually, people began to
                        write to the Duke in order to pass messages on to Grace. Grateful for this understanding
                        and help, Grace called the Duke her
                        Guardian and herself his servant (Thomasin Darling).</p>
<p class="">The Duke was not able to shield Grace
                        from the artistic community, however. The events of that September morning
                        seized the artistic imagination of the era, and painters such as J.W.
                            Carmichael and Thomas Musgrave Joy requested that
                            Grace and her father sit for
                        portraits. Many times, Grace would be
                        forced to reenact awkward positions in order for the painters to properly
                        portray the scene of the Forfarshire&rsquo;s shipwreck. There were also many books
                        dedicated to Grace&rsquo;s story. Many of
                        them were written as romances, with loose treatment of the facts of the
                        event. William Wordsworth commemorated Grace and her actions in verse considered
                        to be beautifully and poetically written, but also greatly romanticized and
                        &ldquo;embarrassing&rdquo; (ODNB). Grace did not
                        read or pay attention to any of the novels, in keeping with her strict
                        upbringing (Thomasin Darling).</p>
<p class="">She continued to &ldquo;politely refuse&rdquo; all offers of paid appearances
                        (Correspondent) and to decline invitations to enter into London society, as Grace was content to focus on her chores and duties at Longstone
                        and to remain a companion and helper to her parents. She refused numerous
                        offers of marriage following her rise in fame (Bruce), and
                        &ldquo;clung to her father and to her name, [explaining] that any husband of hers
                        should take it&rdquo; (Thomasin Darling 11). She showed no
                        indications of yearning for something more than what she had, and refuted
                        the assumption that her quiet life on the island was unfulfilling, stating
                        that she &ldquo;[had] no time to spare&rdquo; as she had &ldquo;seven apartments in the house
                        to keep in a state fit to be inspected every day by Gentlemen, so that [her]
                        hands [were] kept very busy&rdquo; (Mitford, 89 and 90). Despite the
                        external clamor and demands of the public, Grace was satisfied with the quiet confinement, humble industry,
                        and familial duty of the lighthouse. </p>
<p class="">In this way, Grace lived contentedly at
                        the Longstone Lighthouse until a sudden decline in her health occurred after
                        a visit to her oldest brother on Coquet
                            Island in 1842. In the hope of improving her condition, Grace&rsquo;s parents sent her and her sister,
                            Thomasin, to visit a family friend, George
                            Shield, in Wooler
                            (Thomasin Darling, Britain Unlimited). While there, Grace wrote to her parents that she
                        greatly enjoyed spending time with her sister and was beginning to feel
                        better. Thomasin&rsquo;s letters contradicted Grace&rsquo;s claim, however, as she wrote that
                        her sister&rsquo;s coughs remained about the same (Thomasin
                        Darling).</p>
<p class="">The two sisters then went to Alnwick, the
                        residence of the Duke of Northumberland,
                        as the Duke had requested that Grace be
                        treated by his personal doctor. Grace&rsquo;s
                        health never improved, however, and the doctor said that her disease was one
                        which &ldquo;no skill, nor care, nor kindness could arrest&rdquo; (Thomasin
                            Darling 56). In one last attempt to save their daughter, the
                            Darlings sent Grace to
                            Thomasin&rsquo;s home in Bamborough. Much to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, Grace began to show signs of increasing
                        health within the first few days in Bamborough. Despite this short-lived hope, Grace died several days later on
                            October 20th, 1842 at the age of twenty-seven, a victim of
                        what is believed to have been tuberculosis (Thomasin Darling,
                        Britain Unlimited). She was buried in St. Aidan&rsquo;s Churchyard, less than one
                        hundred yards from where she had been born (Britain Unlimited). </p>
<p class="">Though Grace was dead, her fame lived on
                        in literature, art, popular culture, and, most significantly, the national
                        consciousness. As Edith Sitwell put it, &ldquo;to the last day of her
                        life Grace Darling could not see that
                        she had done anything extraordinary&hellip;but she became the pride of the nation&rdquo;
                            (Sitwell 62). Certain types of heroic legend coincided in
                        her, as in the physical courage and prowess of <a href="featured%3Fid=JOAN_OF_ARC.html">Joan of Arc</a>, the wild, indigenous innocence and rescue of <a href="featured%3Fid=POCAHONTAS.html">Pocahontas</a> or Walter Scott's heroines, and
                        other romantic themes apart from love and marriage. In turn, she became a
                        type recognized in other women's deeds around the world, even for
                        predecessors such as the "Grace Darling of Newfoundland," Ann
                            Harvey, who helped to rescue 180 survivors of a shipwreck in
                            1828 (Ann Harvey). To the Victorian Era, Grace stood as an emblem of both British courage and female virtue that
                        resonated deeply with that era's imperialism and idealism. She was a woman
                        with a truly &ldquo;English heart&rdquo;
                            (Mitford) who represented the absolute best of her society,
                        and gave its members hope and faith in a time of transition. </p>
