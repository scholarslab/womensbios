<strong>TOC: </strong>Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; The Duchess of Marlborough; Lady Morgan; Madame d'Arblay [Fanny Burney]; Mrs. Elizabeth Inchbald; The Countess of Blessington; <a href="featured%3Fid=CHARLOTTE_BRONTE.html">Charlotte Bront&euml;</a>; Miss Berry.</p>
      
<p class="notepara">
       
<div class="para">Cambridge University Library stamp 23 Aug 78; labels of spines XXVIII 66 22 and 23. Blue
        cloth 8o; black scrollwork stamps on covers, gilt lettering on spine, black lettering on
        cover; brown floral endpapers. Davenport is identified as Author of "The Artic World, the
        Mediterranean Illustrated, the Bird-World, etc." Dedicated "The the Right Hon. the Countess
        of Glasgow these volumes are by permission respectfully and gratefully dedicated by the
        author."</div>
       
<div class="para">Adams's Preface submits to &ldquo;'general reader&rsquo;&rdquo; reading that should be &ldquo;pleasant and not
        unprofitable&rdquo; for &ldquo;leisure hour,&rdquo; concerning &ldquo;the character of Woman as she appears in the
        world of Literature and Society&rdquo; (capitalized in original). The subjects were &ldquo;chosen
        because they are representative." It is "needless to dwell on the strong moral and
        intellectual distinctions which separate a Harriet Martineau from a Lady Mary Wortley
        Montagu, or a Charlotte Bront&euml; from a Countess of Blessington.&rdquo; umlaut The &ldquo;present volumes
        are confined to English Representative Women; but should they meet with a favourable
        reception from the reading public, the writer on another occasion may venture further
        afield.&rdquo; "January 1878" (vii-viii) </div>
       
<div class="para">Throughout biographies, a horizontal line sets off the header of each page, Representative
        Women (verso), subject's name (recto). First page of each gives subject's name in large caps
        followed by a period and "A.D. 1753-1821" (Inchbald) or the appropriate birth and death
        dates. The narratives are divided into chapters.</div>
       
<div class="para">Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's biography consumes 149 pages, followed by a summary page in
        smaller type giving her name, dates of birth (1690) and death (1762), quoting at length from
        &ldquo;Dallaway,&rdquo; who favorably compares Montagu's learning with other women's. She &ldquo;applied her
        learning to improve her knowledge of the world&hellip;" She showed best in her "purity of style,
        rather than in the ambition of displaying her acquirements&hellip;" She gave "grace of expression
        and novelty to maxims&hellip;&rdquo; (150). Other subjects do not receive such a concluding page "blurb."
        For comparison, Burney or &ldquo;Frances D&rsquo;Arblay&rdquo; [sic] receives five chapters (124 pp.). </div>
       
<div class="para">The biography of Elizabeth Inchbald begins, &ldquo;We have now to tell the story of a Woman who
        in some respects may fairly be considered Representative, though she made no very
        conspicuous figure in what is known as Society, and does not occupy a very high position in
        the republic of Letters. Her life was more remarkable than her works, and her character is a
        more interesting study than her life. Yet had she possessed less of marked individuality,
        and had her career permitted fewer noticeable incidents, she must still have been remembered
        as a dramatist of some ability, and a novelist of no mean order&rdquo; (125) </div>
       
<div class="para">&ldquo;Marguerite, Countess of Blessington, once so famous in London Society, though now little
        more than the shadow of a name, was the third child&hellip;" begins Blessington's biography (176).
        Chapter iv:&ldquo;Lady Blessington&rsquo;s literary career was not, as we have seen, a successful one&rdquo;
        (253). After a slash on p. 263, &ldquo;A few words may be added respecting Count D&rsquo;Orsay" (263-4),
        a unique supplement comparable to Dallaway's words on Montagu. </div>
       
<div class="para">As to Adams's authority and objectivity, he gets some facts wrong and judges by strict
        gender and religious standards. Charlotte Bront&euml;'s dates are given 1817-1855 instead of
        1816-1855. The biography begins: "The Rev. Patrick Blundell, who afterwards assumed the name
        of Bront&euml;, was a native of the county of Down in Ireland&rdquo; (265). The three sisters become
        subjects: Charlotte's "life was so mixed up with the lives of her sisters, that the threads
        cannot be wholly disentangled&hellip;." Perhaps with Gaskell in mind, Adams opines, "We are great
        believers in the power of circumstances to shape and modify character; and we believe that
        the sights and sounds&hellip;in our childhood produce each a strong impression&rdquo; (266-7). &ldquo;We feel
        the breath of the strong Yorkshire breezes in her style&hellip;.Haworth was hardly the place in
        which a lyrist of the Thomas Moore stamp could have grown up and sung; hardly the place to
        have nourished a &lsquo;Wild Irish Girl&rsquo; or an &lsquo;Evelina.&rsquo; But it was no unfitting home for a &lsquo;Jane
        Eyre&rsquo;&rdquo; (267). The biography concludes with Harriet Martineau&rsquo;s famous obituary assessment of
        Charlotte as having the &ldquo;conscientiousness of a saint&rdquo; (342). </div>
       
<div class="para">In her own biography, Adams grants: &ldquo;Harriet Martineau, as all will admit, was a
        remarkable woman; remarkble by virtue of her mental endowments; remarkable for force of
        character; remarkable in her long and active career; and remarkable in her ready acceptance
        of the crude speculations of an inferior mind; but remarkable, beyond everything, for her
        egotism&rdquo; of "sublime proportions" (343). Adams quotes W. R. Greg, &ldquo;Qu&rsquo;elle avait le d&eacute;fauts
        de ses qualit&eacute;s&rdquo; (344), dwelling further on Martineau's denial of merit in other people and
        her conviction that "the world...floated round her own individuality&rdquo; (348). &ldquo;As a novelist
        she cannot be ranked with George Eliot, Charlotte Bront&euml;, or even Mrs. Gaskell. Her strength
        lay in logical force of statement and appositeness of illustration&rdquo; (348). After this
        extensive assessment of Martineau's standing, Adams states that his sketch of her life is
        based on the 
         <i>Autobiography</i>
         , which he faults: it is &ldquo;amusing to perceive the evident belief that the reader
        will dwell as eagerly as she herself dwelt upon even the minutest particulars of her
        childhood&rdquo; (349). &ldquo;It would be uncharitable to criticize too severely the moribund
        utterances of a woman in Harriet Martineau&rsquo;s physical condition&rdquo; (393). Agnoticism is a
        &ldquo;miserable creed&rdquo; (393). </div>
