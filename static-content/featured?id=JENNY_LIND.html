                        arts in society, and public women.</p>
<p class="">In a biographical tribute written shortly after the singer's death, H. S. Holland and W. S.
                            Rockstro introduce their honorary subject with a comment about
                        her name which gives us a measure of the impression she made upon the
                        public:</p>
<p class="block">Even the name of 'Jenny Lind' seemed to be inadequate to the
                        occasion. It is a name which English lips caress with affection, having in
                        it the sense and sound of some homely and endearing diminutive. But here,
                        one felt, was something more than affectionate diminutives could express;
                        something more than a delicious singer. . . something of a rare and majestic
                        type, which broke through the ordinary layers which encrust and imprison our
                        average human life. (6)</p>
<p class="">Here, the stature of the great woman seems out of proportion with the
                        public&rsquo;s terms of intimate affection. Her rise to that stature is all the
                        more remarkable in light of the lack of love or &ldquo;affectionate diminutives&rdquo;
                        that she received during her neglected and impoverished childhood.</p>
<p class="">Johanna Maria Lind was born on October
                            6, 1820 in Stockholm,
                        Sweden, the daughter of working-class Niclas Jonas Lind
                        (1798-1858) and Anne-Marie
                            Fellborg
                        (1793-1856). She was considered illegitimate until age fourteen when
                        her parents were wedded, a second marriage for her mother.
                            Niclas, five years his wife's junior and only aged
                        twenty-two at Jenny's birth, was the unambitious son of a successful
                        lace-manufacturer, who failed in the business when it passed on to himself.
                        He held an unprofitable bookkeeping position and was unable to provide
                        enough income to support his family, but is described in biographies as
                        &ldquo;good-naturedly weak; much given to music of a free and convivial kind&rdquo;
                        (Holland and Rockstro 12). While Jenny may have inherited her father's
                        musical inclinations (he was an amateur singer in community festivals), she
                        certainly possessed none of his weakness of character. The single-minded
                        determination she later exhibited in training her voice for opera is a trait
                        to be found in her mother. Anne-Marie came from a respectable
                        family and was well-educated, qualities which enabled her to earn a living
                        as a schoolmistress when Niclas proved incapable of providing
                        for her. In 1820, she was running a day-school for girls out of
                        their home, where two of the students also boarded. Occupied with the
                        financial concerns of the household, the mother gave the new baby little
                        welcome and soon placed her daughter in the care of strangers.</p>
<p class="">Until
                            1824, Jenny lived in the countryside with a couple, a
                        parish-clerk and organist and his wife. While she was neglected by her
                        parents in early childhood, this was not an entirely unhappy period of her
                        life. Listening to the songs of wild birds, she felt an intense love for the
                        Swedish countryside that she retained even as an accomplished opera
                            singer&mdash;a national &ldquo;instinct&hellip;native to the Swedes,&rdquo;
                        according to biographers. The passion for &ldquo;the country&rdquo; had &ldquo;deep-rooted
                        dominion&rdquo; over Jenny Lind, and in turn she personified country folk.</p>
<p class="block">She was in close touch with all that belongs to a simple
                        peasantry. She knew the tones of its songs; and the rhythm of its dances;
                        its simplicity, its charm, its pathos&mdash;all were hers. Something of its native
                        depth and dignity seemed to have passed into her. (Holland and Rockstro
                        13)</p>
<p class="">During her musical career as the &ldquo;Swedish
                            Nightingale,&rdquo; this indigenous quality was cherished by
                        international audiences of all ranks and the combination of homeliness and
                        powerful feelings which she displayed in performance was part of her common
                        appeal.</p>
<p class="">While Jenny's years in the countryside made a lasting impression, they were
                        short-lived. In 1824, she was brought back to town and for a
                        period of time, lived with her grandmother in a respectable almshouse for
                        the widows of Stockholm burghers. Here, she received affectionate care and
                        was taught a sense of religion and morality which guided her later charity
                        work. Her grandmother was the first to recognize the small child's musical
                        abilities, overhearing her one day at the piano and thereafter, her natural
                        talent was celebrated by neighboring widows who came to hear her sing.
                        Around 1828, her mother's day-school closed and economic
                        constraints once again disrupted Jenny's home-life. She was handed over to
                        the care of a childless couple who had placed an advertisement in the paper
                        for a child to come live with them. The husband was the steward and tenant
                        in the lodge-house of the same almshouse where her grandmother lived, so
                        happily, she was not removed from all familial relations when her mother
                        left Stockholm shortly after to take a governess position. However, in this
                        couple's guardianship, she spent many hours alone and a cat became the
                        audience for her songs. The clear, high voice carried to other ears, and one
                        of the people who heard from the street changed the course of Jenny's
                        life.</p>
<p class="">The
                        anecdote of her discovery is lovingly retold in nearly all biographies. The
                        version one presenter includes as having come from the singer's recollection
                        and recorded by her son, may be considered relatively authoritative:</p>
<p class="block">Her favourite seat with her cat was in the window of the
                        Steward's rooms. . . and there she sat and sang to it; and the people
                        passing in the street used to hear, and wonder; and amongst others the maid
                        of a Mademoiselle Lundberg, [the principal] dancer at the Royal
                        Opera House; and the maid told her mistress that she had never heard such
                        beautiful singing as this little girl sang to her cat&hellip;.[When] Mademoiselle
                        Lundberg&hellip;.heard her sing, she said, 'The child is a genius; you must have her educated for
                            the stage.' (Holland and Rockstro 17)</p>
<p class="">Included in this version, but not in the one to follow, is the detail that it
                        was a maid who first appreciated the beauty of Jenny's voice before
                        Mademoiselle confirmed the discovery. One can speculate that the maid's
                        absence from other versions is due to the uncomfortable suggestion that a
                        lower-class person might have discerning taste, whether or not acquired in
                        service to an artistic mistress. Regardless of narrative intent, the maid,
                        when she is present in the story of Jenny's discovery, figuratively predicts
                        the appeal the singer had in her career to not only high, but low audiences,
                        as well. The tone of this version of the discovery is strikingly
                        different:</p>
<p class="block">There was once a poor and plain little girl dwelling in a little
                        room, in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. She was a poor little girl indeed
                        then; she was lonely and neglected, and would have been very unhappy,
                        deprived of kindness and care so necessary to a child, if it had not been
                        for a peculiar gift. The little girl had a fine voice, and in her
                        loneliness, in trouble or in sorrow, she consoled herself by singing. In
                        fact, she sung to all she did; at her work, at her play, running or resting,
                        she always sung.</p>
<p class="block">The woman who had her in care went out to work during the day,
                        and used to lock in the little girl, who had nothing to enliven her solitude
                        but the company of a cat. The little girl played with her cat and sung. Once
                        she sat by the open window and stroked her cat and sang, when a lady passed
                        by. She heard the voice, and looked up and saw the little singer. She asked
                        the child several questions, went away, and came back several days later,
                        followed by an old music-master, whose name was Croelius
                        [singing-master at the Royal Theater]. He tried the little girl's musical
                        ear and voice, and was astonished. (Willis 5)</p>
<p class="">When the discernment of Jenny's talent originates with the lady, the story
                        can be placed in a neatly defined package. The woman of a better class
                        provides charitable assistance to one of the less fortunate class: a secure
                        hierarchy&mdash;as opposed to the destabilizing potential when a servant assists a
                        poor girl to rise to the level of renown that is recognized by royalty, her
                        name is on the lips of kings and queens. This presenter elects to replace
                        Jenny's name with &ldquo;(poor) little girl,&rdquo; and inflects the story with such
                        pathos that ones can see the tendency towards reducing her to &ldquo;endearing
                        diminutives&rdquo; which Holland and Rockstro suggest
                        obscured the public's recognition of her rare and intense artistic talent.
                        The maudlin affect veils the slippage between class and status
                        boundaries&mdash;what I consider to be the most critically significant part of her
                        biographical story&mdash;in the 'once upon a time' of fairy tales.</p>
<p class="">Although the
                        head of the Royal Theater of Stockholm nearly rejected Jenny when he saw
                            her&mdash;&ldquo;a small,
                            ugly, broad-nosed, shy, gauche, under-grown girl!&rdquo; (a
                        self-description from one of her letters)&mdash;she was accepted at the Royal
                        Opera School after he was moved to tears by her voice (Holland and Rockstro
                        18). There, she found her home on the stage. The Royal Theater assumed
                        guardianship of her and she was brought up, educated and received vocal
                        training at the expense of the government. By age ten, she made her first
                        appearance singing and dancing on stage and continued to play children's
                        parts in productions. Yet at adolescence, her voice changed; it lost the clarity
                        and high tone which had received so much praise. Several years passed before
                        Jenny would gain the chance to debut in the theater of Stockholm; however,
                        with determined study she mastered the new quality of her voice. Such a
                        trial would occur again at the height of the opera singer's career, when she
                        lost her voice and had to learn how to retrain it before she was able to
                        return to performing. Her commitment through this early ordeal signaled that
                        she had taken on singing as work. No longer the little girl who was
                        discovered to have such talent, Jenny Lind had claimed for herself the place
                        of a serious professional artist.</p>
<p class="">On March 7, 1838, audiences made a sensation of her performance
                        as Agathe in Carl Weber's
                        <em>Der Freisch&uuml;tz</em>. This was the first great role of
                        Jenny's many onstage triumphs and made her a favorite of the Royal Swedish
                        Opera. At age 20, she was accepted as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy
                        of Music and was appointed as a court singer to the royalty of Sweden and Norway. However, her popularity strained her
                        voice; over-exertion left it sounding harsh. Determined again to save her
                        musical powers, she traveled to Paris
                        seeking Manuel Garc&iacute;a, the famous baritone who became a vocal
                        instructor for the Paris Conservatory, and later, the Royal Academy of Music
                        in London. Before forbidding her to sing a note for three months, he
                        famously told her: &ldquo;My
                            dear child, you have no voice. Or, you have had a voice and are just
                            going to lose it&rdquo; (Lind-Goldschmidt 13). The period of silence
                        repaired her voice, and nearly a year's tutelage under Garc&iacute;a
                        saved the opera-singer's career. When Jenny returned to the stage, audiences
                        were not fickle to their one-time favorite, but immediately embraced her
                        again.</p>
<p class="">Not only was she appreciated in performance, but she was also welcomed in
                        literary and artistic circles of society. Though she lacked the beauty and
                        sophistication of the usual prima donna, she evidently blended in easily at
                        refined soirees, as an anecdote about her posing in a recreation of an
                        Italian Baroque painting at a party of fellow-artists suggests:</p>
<p class="block">she appeared, at a Stockholm party, in a tableau-vivant, as
                        Carlo Dolce's St Cecilia [the patron saint of musicians]: and it was said
                        that she looked exceedingly like the picture: and she took special delight
                        in this personal resemblance to the Saint Cecilia; and after her death there
                        was found, among her private stores of little mementoes [<em>sic</em>], the rouge-card used at the tableaux, with her own writing on
                        the back to say that it had been given her by Fredrika Bremer as a memorial
                        of that evening. (Holland and Rockstro 85)</p>
<p class="">Along with novelist Fredrika Bremer, Jenny was intimate with
                        many significant figures of literature and music, including Hans
                            Christian Andersen, sculptor Georg Jensen, and
                        composers Mendelssohn, Chopin,
                            Meyerbeer, and A.F. Lindblad, &ldquo;the Schubert of
                            Sweden&rdquo; (Holland and Rockstro 4). Although she appeared
                        unsophisticated, the dramatic range of the roles she played mirrored a depth
                        of character which many found to be personally, as well as artistically,
                        engaging. These relationships showed her to be exceptional in several ways:
                        she was of the lower class yet many recognized an inherent sense of
                        refinement about her; she was a popular entertainer yet recognized by
                        cultured members of society as an artist of their own kind; and she was a
                        woman of the Victorian era publicly accepted into the company of men. One
                        biography notes the admiration Jenny's character won amongst serious minds:
                        &ldquo;Its peculiar force lay in this&mdash;that it held enthralled the highest and best
                        minds in Europe. It was the men of genius who recognized in her something
                        akin to themselves&rdquo; (Holland and Rockstro 4). In her late twenties, she was
                        inducted as the only female member of a student fraternity in G&ouml;ttingen, Germany called
                        Burschenschaft Hannovera. Amongst the men of this classical German
                        organization she was fondly known as &ldquo;Little Lady
                            Jenny&rdquo;&mdash;endearing diminutives were attached to her name even as
                        she was distinguished from a commonly recognized form of femininity (Holland
                        and Rockstro 375).</p>
<p class="">For some of those who knew Jenny, esteem for her rare character and intellect
                        developed into romantic interest. Her fine grey eyes and sincere nature
                        captured the heart of Hans Christian Andersen when he met her during a
                        concert tour of Denmark, prompting him to write two of his most famous
                        stories in her honor, <em>The Ugly Duckling</em> and <em>The Nightingale</em>, the source of her stage name the
                        &ldquo;Swedish Nightingale.&rdquo; She was also an inspiration for
                            Mendelssohn as well as Chopin, both of whom
                        composed operas with her voice in mind. While nineteenth century biographies
                        acknowledge her professional relationships with these two men, a more
                        intimate association was not considered until new biographical information
                        surfaced that could unsettle some revered reputations. Professor
                            Curtis Price (formerly of the Royal Academy of Music in
                        London) claims in a recent biography on Mendelssohn that the married
                        composer was desperately in love with the singer. Price alleges that in
                            1847, Mendelssohn begged her to elope with him and
                        threatened suicide upon her refusal. A few months later, Mendelssohn was, in
                        fact, dead; however, this scandal of musical history remains a speculation
                        since the documents were sealed by an affidavit secured by Lind's husband in
                            1896. Jenny's requited romance with Chopin has been
                        publicly substantiated, though only very recently has it been discussed in
                        biography. Evidence shows that she obtained <a href="featured%3Fid=QUEEN_VICTORIA.html">Queen Victoria's</a> approval to marry him 1849. The
                        union never occurred because Chopin was fatally ill, but Jenny is said to
                        have sung at his bedside while the composer was dying. On February
                            5, 1852, while touring America, she married pianist Otto Goldschmidt (who had been one of Mendelssohn's
                        pupils), becoming a new bride at the rather late age of thirty-one.</p>
<p class="">Jenny's American concert tour greatly increased her fame, but her association
                        with P.T. Barnum, who financed the tour, had an unfortunate
                        impact on her reputation. Under the strain of continuous performance, the
                        exhausted singer was considering a transition to retirement, wanting to
                        commit herself to benefit appearances only. Barnum convinced her to make a
                        tour of America by promising that she would earn enough money to pay for her
                        retirement and fund her project of establishing several new schools in
                        Sweden. Counting on the extraordinarily high ticket sales of her tours in
                        Great Britain, the self-titled &ldquo;Greatest Showman on Earth&rdquo; introduced the
                        &ldquo;Swedish Nightingale,&rdquo; hitherto unknown by American audiences, in
                        advertisements touting her moral purity and social benevolence as much as
                        vocal talent. He began publicizing the tour half a year in advance of her
                        arrival, citing the free benefit concerts she had given as a promotional
                        tool to increase his profits from the 150 shows she was contracted for
                        (after 93 performances, she ended their agreement). While Jenny donated
                        nearly all of the $250,000 she made during the tour, Barnum's commercial
                        exploitation muddied what, for her, was a genuinely altruistic use for her
                        immense celebrity. Critics focused on the spectacle made of and by her in
                        the United States and her charitably intended tour was repeatedly parodied
                        in the press.</p>
<p class="">
<div class="bio-fig">
<a href="bios/JennyHumbug.jpg"><img alt="" src="bios/JennyHumbug.jpg"></a>
<p></p>
</div>A cartoon by New York engraver William
                            Schaus entitled &ldquo;Panorama of Humbug&rdquo; (1850) satirizes the extent
                        of the advertizing campaign that Barnum orchestrated to launch the &ldquo;Swedish
                        Nightingale&rdquo; to popularity before she even sang a note for an American
                            audience. <a href="featured%3Fid=JENNY_LIND.html#JENNY_LIND_NOTE_1" class="note-link">[1]</a> It shows the public frenzy
                        that greeted her arrival being created by showmen campaigning on the street
                        as Barnum watches from behind a curtain in an inconspicuous corner of the
                        picture. A colossal image of Jenny, nightingale perched in hand, dominates
                        the background and immediately draws our eye to her; an optical effect which
                        ironically mimics the humbuggery being scrutinized. The cartoon shows the
                        friction between her marketability as an eminent figure and her efforts to
                        make philanthropic use of her eminence. At the same time, her hugeness in
                        the picture suggests another reading: that Barnum's puffery as unnecessary
                        because the reputation which earned her such public stature served as its
                        own advertisement.</p>
<p class="">
<div class="bio-fig">
<a href="bios/QueenJenny.jpg"><img alt="" src="bios/QueenJenny.jpg"></a>
<p></p>
</div>The approval Barnum generated for the singer before
                        audiences even heard her voice corroborated claims from across the Atlantic
                        that the taste of the American public was guided by popular opinion rather
                        than refined discrimination. A cartoon called &ldquo;Coronation of Jenny the
                        First&mdash;Queen of the Americans&rdquo; (1850) which appeared in <em>Punch</em> is a satirical comment upon the lack of sophistication
                        amongst her American fans. <a href="featured%3Fid=JENNY_LIND.html#JENNY_LIND_NOTE_2" class="note-link">[2]</a> Before a raucous
                        and apparently low-classed crowd of people, some prostrate in homage, some
                        whooping and leaping, sits Jenny, being crowned as their popularly elected
                        Queen. Paradoxically, the reference to her royal associations reminds us
                        that the high shared their appreciation of her with the low, challenging the
                        association between lack of taste and lack of status. As though she were
                        Victoria, whom the cartoon rendering immediately calls to mind, Jenny's
                        countenance is as gravely sober as if she were being charged with royal
                        responsibilities. Imaging her as a double for Victoria (even though it was
                        intended to be a parody) encourages us to consider these two women
                        collectively, as both were in highly public positions at the same time as
                        they were figures of feminine virtue for an emerging middle-class
                        ideology.</p>
<p class="">The effect of collecting forms of womanhood is present in another cartoon
                        titled &ldquo;To Jenny Lind, From Punch,&rdquo; which makes satire of one of the only
                        public roles that Victorian women could engage in without compromising their
                        femininity: charity work. Jenny is shown in the middle of the picture
                        holding a basket of food&mdash;an object symbolizing the charitable woman's
                        mission. She stands in a Madonna-like pose, her eyes are downcast, her arm
                        and hand extended to comfort the impoverished crowd of shoeless wretches and
                        mothers bearing infants, who kneel in a circle at her feet. This exaggerated
                        portrait of the ministering angel parodies Jenny's philanthropic activities;
                        yet at the same time, the cartoon's figure for satire runs up against
                        prosopography, which uses the same topos image to present genuinely worthy
                        heroines as models for women's public contributions. Many of the ministering
                        figures found in collected biography shared the mission of charity work and
                        Jenny, who donated concert proceeds to <a href="featured%3Fid=FLORENCE_NIGHTINGALE.html">Florence Nightingale's</a> Nursing Fund at the end of the Crimean
                        War, provides us with an example of one heroine supporting a cause
                        championed by another.</p>
<p class="">Although she continued to give performances to raise money for the needy,
                        Jenny retired from her professional stage career when she completed the
                        concert tour of America in 1852. The Goldschmidts settled into
                        the calm of domestic life and raised two sons, Walter and Ernest, and a daughter who shared the same
                        endearingly diminutive name as her mother. In 1883, Jenny gave
                        her last charitable performance and during the same year, her vocal talent
                        received one more public acknowledgment when the Prince of Wales appointed
                        her as the first professor of singing at the newly established Royal College
                        of Music. On
                            November 2, 1887, Jenny died of cancer at her home in
                        Wynd's Point, England. Although this phenomenal celebrity of the nineteenth
                        century has been largely forgotten today, evidence of her popularity is
                        preserved in an incredible amount of material culture from the era. Her name
                        and image can be found on everyday items from cigar boxes, hard liquor,
                        perfumes, plate ware, tea sets, furniture, pastry recipes, even train cars.
                        Jenny's legacy as a professional artist earned her a place in high culture
                        alongside her male peers. Near Handel's statue in Poet's Corner at Westminster
                        Abbey, a plaque is dedicated in honor of her musical accomplishments. </p>
