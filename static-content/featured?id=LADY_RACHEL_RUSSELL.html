<p class="">An enamored biography of Lady Rachel Russell by Charles Bruce emphasizes her
                        eminence in English history, and begins with customary reflections on the
                        gender difference within historicity: &ldquo;The deeds of heroes have been the
                        theme historians have loved to record, but the devotedness and gentleness of
                        women they have usually passed by&hellip;.&rdquo; Monarchs, wars, crimes have filled
                        annals, but history rarely preserves &ldquo;the life-deeds and names of women&rdquo;
                        unless they &ldquo;have lost the finer qualities of womanhood, and are conspicuous
                        by possessing attributes usually supposed to belong to the opposite and
                        sterner sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="block">Few women are to be compared with the wife of the unfortunate
                        Lord William Russell; and we may safely hope that the evil times in which
                        she lived will never again return to curse this fair England of ours. In her
                        mournful history are seen those noble characteristics which are usually
                        alone to be found depicted in the pages of romance. In her they were actual
                        and real,&mdash;the strength, and beauty, and glory of her life; they shine forth
                        in her power of self-denial, in the entire devotion to the memory of her
                        murdered lord, in her study for the well-being of their children, no less
                        than in the persistent goodness of heart, the sincere religiousness of
                        conduct, resplendent alike in her happiness and in her sorrow, which, as the
                        ages glide away, live and brighter grow: time can never dim them.</p>
<p class="block">How purely bright her story shines out amid the
                            darkness of the reigns of the worthless Charles II and his brother
                        James! That was an evil period of national transition from the cruel
                        despotism of the Stuarts towards constitutional government.</p>
<p class=""> Bruce recounts Lady Russell's birth in 1636, descendant on her mother's side
                        of French Huguenots of high rank, and her early adoption of correct
                        principles of freedom of religion and sympathy for others. Whereas the <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em> emphasizes
                        the life-long attachment between Rachel Wriothesley and her sister Elizabeth
                        as well as her half-sister by their father's second wife, another Elizabeth,
                        Bruce follows a tradition of reading Lady Russell through her exemplary
                        loving marriage. Bruce's biography passes quickly through an arranged
                        marriage, at seventeen (Bruce says she was eighteen), to Lord Vaughan, the
                        elder son of the Earl of Carbery, though this amicable union was an
                        opportunity for a broad education at the Carbery estate in Wales.</p>
<p class=""> The Restoration in 1660 brought political power back to the loyal nobility,
                        and hence more access to London for those in that party. In 1670 the
                        high-ranked, wealthy, beautiful, and charming young widow married William
                        Russell, handsome, ambitious younger son of the first Duke of Bedford.
                        Collective biographies celebrate the union as a model of companionate
                        marriage based on love and mutual understanding. "How tender, and yet how
                        touching, are her letters, especially those of her earlier wedded life, sent
                        to her husband during his occasional absences from home! Many of those
                        earlier letters have been preserved. They are written in a negligent style
                        and in homely phrase.... But they evince a warm interest in all his
                        concerns, and are filled with items of home news, such as the health and
                        amusements of their children; and little scraps of intelligence of the
                        affairs of the day...; and ... also little bits of chit-chat about the
                        fashionable world of that time; the gossips, frivolities, and follies of the
                        court of the King...." </p>
<p class=""> Bruce quotes from Lady Russell's letters: she
                        prays, for example, that God "will continue to me all these joys," or give
                        "strength to submit without murmuring to His wise arrangements.... He knows
                        better than we, at what moment we have obtained and enjoyed enough here
                        below. That which I earnestly implore of His compassion is, that no matter
                        which of us may first depart, the other may not despair, as if without hope
                        of finding his beloved one again." In another letter, she writes of the
                        pleasure of reading Lord Russell's letters or writing to him, though words
                        cannot express the passion she feels for him. Lady Russell confirms that her
                        love "burned clearer and steadier, purer and brighter" as the years passed.
                        Although romantic love is a constant theme, her letters also depict the
                        lives of their three surviving children, and increasingly reveal Rachel as
                        an informed and well-connected political strategist. </p>
<p class="">This status quo must of course change, taking narrative shape: during "years
                        of domestic happiness and peace," the "cloud" of crisis was building: after
                        the "virtue and heroic spirit" of the Commonwealth, the decadence of Charles
                        II had become intolerable; patriots saw him as "the pensioner of the French
                        king," a secret papist; "Parliament was corrupt and servile, the standing
                        army a burden and terror." Lady Russell encouraged her husband's
                        consultations with leaders in France and England, but tried to guide him to
                        be diplomatic in any opposition to the English court and ruling party. In
                        Bruce's narrative, Lady Russell takes the more passive role of loving
                        wife.</p>
<p class="">Lord Hollis and Lord Russell were among those who began to seek an
                        alternative for the country: "Was royal tyranny to have it all its own way?
                        ...Was the nation to remain prostrate or become free? The nobility of
                        Russell's mind, his lofty and honourable principles, and his glowing
                        patriotism, made him shrink with repugnance from the very thought of calling
                        in foreign aid," yet with others he hoped to revive the spirit that overcame
                        Charles I. (In fact, there was glaring evidence that he had consulted with
                        potential French allies on ways to resist Charles II.) If another
                        Commonwealth was out of the question, they might found a constitutional
                        monarchy, Bruce recounts. "...The entire State was at the feet of a
                        debauched ruler and his profligate women. Russell resolved these weighty
                        matters &mdash; alas! without consulting his noble wife." The patriots gambled on
                        the success of a perilous plan to overthrow tyranny, but (Bruce insists)
                        they had nothing to do with the plot to assassinate the King. "In an evil
                        hour, Russell, Essex, Algernon Sidney, and Hampden admitted Lord Howard to
                        their counsels,&mdash;a man of a fickle nature and malignant heart, a hasty
                        conspirator, and a ready traitor. Howard... secretly went to the King, at
                        the apartments of the Duchess of Portsmouth, and informed him of all....
                        Intelligence of the discovery was immediately conveyed to the conspirators.
                        Lord Shaftesbury fled into Holland; Essex was placed in the Tower, where he
                        speedily destroyed himself; Lord Russell was arrested, and taken before the
                        Council. The King presided, keenly watching the noble prisoner, and already
                        resolved that he should not escape, if it were possible to destroy him. The
                        examination was long and perplexing, and at its close Russell was committed
                        to the Tower. On entering that gloomy fortress&mdash;the dungeon home through
                        weary years, and at last the grave of many a gallant heart&mdash;he said to his
                        valet: 'They will have my life; the devil is unloosed.'[Note: See Eclectic
                        Review, 1856.]"</p>
<p class="block">Eighteen days passed away between Lord Russell's committal to
                        the Tower and his trial. During that period of suspense, Lady Russell was
                        indefatigable in her endeavours to obtain all possible information relative
                        to the trial, and to provide for her husband's defence. Prompted by the
                        tenderest affection for her lord, she was desirous of being present at the
                        trial, that she might support him by her sympathy, and assist him by taking
                        notes of the evidence; and she writes to him to obtain his permission,
                        saying, "Your friends, believing I can do you some service at your trial, I
                        am extremely willing to try; my resolution will hold out&mdash;pray let yours. But
                        it may be the Court will not let me; however, do you let me try. I think,
                        however, to meet you at Richardson's, and then resolve. Your brother Ned
                        will be with me." His consent was given; and when, on Friday, July 13, 1683,
                        he was placed within the bar of the Old Bailey to undergo his trial for high
                        treason, Lady Russell was close by him.</p>
<p class="">In some versions, it is Lord Russell who on the spot requests his wife as
                        clerk and advisor at the trial, but this scene at the trial was apparently
                        pre-arranged by Lady Russell. Bruce relies on historical narratives of the
                        scene of trial, contrasting the weak-willed presiding judge and the infamous
                        prosecutors (Lord Macaulay described Jeffreys as insolent, irascible, and
                        "'the most consummate bully ever known in the profession'"). "After a few
                        objections as to some legal points had been raised by Russell and overruled
                        by the court, he asked for the use of pen, ink, and paper, and for
                        permission to use such papers as he had with him; and these requests being
                        granted, he, wishing to have notes of the evidence taken, asked whether he
                        might have somebody to write for him...." He was allowed to have a servant
                        assist him, and to everyone's surprise he announced, "'My wife is here ready
                        to do it.' 'If her ladyship will take the trouble, she can do so,' said the
                        judge; and the thronging spectators could not refrain from expressions of
                        sympathy and admiration, when the noble woman, calm, self-possessed, and
                        majestic, seated herself by the side of the man she loved so tenderly and
                        well, and whom she was so soon to lose. During the long and tedious trial,
                        ever ready with wise suggestions, Lady Russell was at once her husband's
                        secretary and counsellor; but neither able self-defence nor the more
                        powerful eloquence of her tears could avert his impending doom. He was
                        convicted and condemned, and warned to prepare for speedy death."</p>
<p class="">Bruce makes a fairly dramatic narrative of the efforts, led by the active
                        Lady Russell, to sway the king to pardon the prisoner. Appeals from "many of
                        her friends, high in rank, and high in favour at Court," were followed by an
                        offer of &pound;100,000 from Lord Russell's father, but Charles refused money and
                        ignored the public letter of appeal from the grieving father. "Indeed, it
                        appears quite certain that the King was afraid of his condemned captive; for
                        when Lord Dartmouth represented to him that some regard was due to Lord
                        Southampton's daughter and her children,&mdash; that to pardon Lord Russell would
                        lay an eternal obligation on a very great family, while the taking of his
                        life would never be forgiven,&mdash;Charles replied, 'All that is as true as that,
                        if I do not take his life, he will soon have mine.'"</p>
<p class="">Lord Russell himself wrote letters of appeal and apology to both Charles and
                        the Duke of York, disclaiming any intention of harming the king and begging
                        for mercy and exile. Lady Russell asked for her uncle, the Marquis de
                        Ruvigny, to come from the court of France to intervene, but Charles replied
                        to the French ambassador, "'I am well convinced that the King my brother
                        would not advise me to pardon a man who would have given me no quarter; I do
                        not wish to prevent M. de Ruvigny from coming here, but my Lord Russell will
                        be beheaded before he arrives. I owe this example both for my own safety and
                        the good of my kingdom.'"</p>
<p class="">Lady Russell next hoped to delay the execution, and Lady Ranelagh recommended
                        that she petition the king in person; many classic narratives include the
                        direct, weeping petition at the sovereign's feet to spare the child or
                        husband from death: "she threw herself at his feet, and with streaming eyes
                        and in a broken voice pleaded for her husband's life. The King was
                        immoveable. Then she implored that, if his doom was irrevocably sealed, to
                        grant him a short reprieve from Saturday to Monday; but even this slight
                        favour was cruelly denied."</p>
<p class="block">When Lady Russell informed her husband of the utter failure of
                        all her efforts... he was somewhat moved, and observed that he thought such
                        a thing was never denied to common felons; and when his wife left the
                        prison, he said to Dr. Burnet, 'I wish she would give over beating every
                        bush, and running hither and thither for my preservation; but when I
                        consider that it will be some mitigation of her sorrow afterwards to reflect
                        that she left nothing undone that could have given any probable hope, I am
                        satisfied.'</p>
<p class="">As if concerned that Lord Russell comes across as unworthy of his wife's
                        loyal campaign to save him, Bruce follows up with evidence that Russell was
                        standing on principle. He refused to try to save himself by signing a
                        declaration supporting the absolute authority of the sovereign, instead
                        upholding the right of "a free nation" to "defend their religion and
                        liberties," and Lady Russell supported his resolution, "for she agreed with
                        him in the sentiment that the duty of submission to rulers is neither
                        absolute nor unconditional." </p>
<p class="">Bruce's narrative rarely follows Lady Russell's point of view, instead fixing
                        its focus on the prison cell as observed by a surviving companion, Burnet,
                        who published a memoir. Burnet testifies to the condemned man's admiration,
                        love, and sympathy for the wife who would suffer at their last parting; the
                        final scene would be the worst of it. "'... I am afraid she will hardly be
                        able to bear it. The concern about preserving me fills her mind so now, that
                        it in some measure supports her; but when that shall be over, I fear the
                        quickness of her spirits will work all within her.' 'I never saw his heart
                        so near failing him,' writes Burnet, 'as when he spake of her. Sometimes I
                        saw a tear in his eye, and he would turn about, and presently change the
                        discourse.'"</p>
<p class="">Bruce's account continues to follow a kind of screenplay dictated by Burnet.
                        Again in a classic topos of presentation of children, Lady Russell with
                        their three children comes to the Tower on the eve of the execution,"that he
                        might give them his blessing and take his last farewell of them. 'I saw him
                        receive them,' says Burnet, 'with his ordinary serenity.' After conversing
                        with them for some time, of their education and their future, he gave them
                        his parting blessing, and dismissed them tenderly.'" Then husband and wife
                        share a final supper, both suppressing their feelings. He remained
                        "'cheerful, and spoke of the many illustrious men who had met death with
                        calmness and fortitude. Then came the final parting: taking her by the hand,
                        the condemned man said, "This flesh you now feel, in a few hours must be
                        cold." He kissed her again and again, and yet again, and, as she turned to
                        depart, he followed her with his eyes in silent agony. There had been no
                        passionate cries and sobs, no bitter waitings of despair; their grief was
                        too deep for tears.'"</p>
<p class="block">When his wife had disappeared, Lord Russell turned to Burnet,
                        and said, "Now the bitterness of death is past;" adding at intervals, in his
                        grief, "What a blessing she has been to me! God has shown me remarkable
                        mercy in giving me such a wife &mdash; birth, fortune, great intellect, great
                        piety, great love for me; it has been all that! And, above all, her conduct
                        in this extremity! It is a great consolation to me to leave my children in
                        the hands of such a mother: she has promised me to take care of herself on
                        their account, and she will do it."</p>
<p class="block">While the affectionate wife was doubtless spending her night in
                        tears, her noble husband was preparing himself for death. To Dr. Burnet he
                        said, "What an immense change death must make in us! what new and marvellous
                        scenes must open before our soul! I have heard it said of men who were born
                        blind, that they were stricken with stupor when, after the cataract had
                        fallen from their eyes, they were able to see; how great would this have
                        been if the first object they had looked upon had been the rising sun!" At
                        one o'clock he sank into a sound and refreshing sleep, from which his
                        servant awoke him at four in the morning. He desired Burnet to convey to his
                        wife his most affectionate remembrance, and to tell her that she would have
                        a place in his last prayers. He then wound up his watch, saying "I have done
                        with time; eternity is at hand." He was executed at Lincoln's Inn Fields on
                        the morning of July 21, 1683, in the forty-fourth year of his age. To the
                        very last moment he exhibited an unwavering calmness and fortitude, a
                        Christian stedfastness and heroism, which, combined with the principles for
                        which he died, has gathered so magnificent a lustre round his name.</p>
<p class="block">In this, the hour of her severest trial, Lady Russell doubtless
                        never lacked the sympathy of her friends, which, with her repose in Divine
                        Providence and her own noble nature, enabled her to bear up bravely beneath
                        it all. It is not till two months after her lord's execution we gain any
                        precise information concerning her state of mind, and this in a letter
                        written to Dr. Fitzwilliam, an old and attached friend, in which she says:
                        "I need not tell you, good Doctor, how little capable I have been of such an
                        exercise as this... confused as my yet amazed mind is. But such men as
                        you,... my friend, will, I know, bear with my weakness and compassionate my
                        distress....You that knew us both, and how we lived, must allow I have just
                        cause to bewail my loss. I know it is common to others to lose a friend; but
                        to have lived with such a one, it may be questioned how few can glory in the
                        like happiness, so, consequently, lament the like loss. Who can but shrink
                        from such a blow!</p>
<p class="block">"Lord, let me understand the reason of these dark and wounding
                        providences, that I sink not under the discouragement of my own thoughts! I
                        know I have deserved my punishment, and will be silent under it; but yet
                        secretly my heart mourns, too sadly, I fear, and cannot be comforted.... I
                        want him to talk with, to walk with, to eat and sleep with. All these things
                        are irksome to me. The day unwelcome, and the night so too; all company and
                        meals I would avoid, if it might be: yet all this is, that I enjoy not the
                        world in my own way.... When I see my children before me, I remember the
                        pleasure he took in them: this makes my heart shrink. Can I regret his
                        quitting a lesser good for a greater? Oh! if I did but stedfastly believe, I
                        could not be dejected.... No; I most willingly forsake this world...in which
                        I have no other business but to rid my soul of sin, secure by faith and a
                        good conscience my eternal interests, with patience and courage bear my
                        eminent misfortune, and ever hereafter be above the smiles and frowns of
                        fortune." Later she responded to a letter of spiritual comfort sent to her
                        anonymously by John Howe, concurring in the view that everlasting joy
                        overrules the temporary loss of an earthly love.</p>
<p class="">The heartfelt letters of grief and faith reveal one aspect of Lady Russell's
                        character, but she in fact maintained a very active engagement with this
                        world. She ensured that Lord Russell's scaffold speech, which she had helped
                        to compose, was widely "circulated an hour after his death," defending his
                        political position. Rumors grew that it was a false document, but "Lady
                        Russell warmly contradicted this false charge in a letter addressed to the
                        King himself; in which she informs him, that the things set down in her
                        husband's speech were such as he had often talked over with her, and that
                        the words written down were his, she could avow, as they were written by her
                        desire. 'I do humbly beg your Majesty,' she concludes, 'would be so
                        charitable as to believe that he, who in all his life was observed to act
                        with the greatest clearness and sincerity, would not, at the point of death,
                        do so disingenuous and false a thing as to deliver for his own what was not
                        properly and expressly so.'"</p>
<p class="block">Soon after her husband's death she removed to Woburn, and there
                        resolved personally to apply herself to the task of conducting the education
                        of her children. And this resolution she carried out with her usual
                        promptitude, energy, and perseverance; and it is pleasing to think that her
                        labours were not in vain, but were crowned with success. She appears to have
                        been her accomplished daughters' sole instructress. Her chief aim in
                        training them was to make them good rather than great. To the Earl of
                        Rochester she said, "I do assure your lordship I have much more care to make
                        my children worthy to be great than to see them so. I will do what I can
                        that they may deserve to be so, and then quietly wait what will follow." And
                        this intention is fully borne out by the contents of a long letter addressed
                        to her children, discovered and published in 1850. It is full of tenderness,
                        wisdom, and earnest exhortations to follow the noble pathway of duty.
                        Faithfully indeed did she fulfil her husband's last behest&mdash;she lived for her
                        children, laboured for their highest benefit, and, patiently waiting until
                        she should join her beloved one in the home of eternal peace, she was
                        permitted to see her posterity honoured, virtuous, and esteemed by the
                        entire English nation, who, enjoying that freedom to obtain which Russell
                        died, forgot not, in their regard for his children, what was due to their
                        noble father.</p>
<p class="">Bruce paints with a soft brush, aided by Lady Russell's account of her
                        motives, but clearly she was what we would call a player in political events
                        and social alliances of the new regime. Her grief, Bruce concedes, did not
                        "paralyze her actions; her forty years of widowhood were not passed in
                        alienation from her kind" within a home circle. "Her letters amply prove
                        that she never became neglectful of the duties incumbent upon her,"
                        including aid to the exiled Huguenots. More broadly, in her "long life she
                        saw many changes. She saw the Stuarts hurled from the throne they had
                        disgraced...; she saw the reign of William and Mary, and that of Anne; she
                        saw the accession of the House of Hanover." By 1694, Lord Russell's father
                        had been raised to a dukedom, making her son next in succession. She
                        arranged stellar marriages for each of her children that confirmed their
                        place in Whig power and as feme sole, she handled her own financial affairs
                        and managed her estates with great success.</p>
<p class="block">Surviving the loss of two of her children, she finally expired
                        at Southampton House, on the 29th September 1723, in the arms of the last,
                        who was then Duchess of Devonshire. She died, beloved and honoured by all
                        men, not alone for her great historic name, not alone for the sake of her
                        illustrious husband, the martyr of freedom, but for her gentleness of soul,
                        her sublime devotion to her husband's memory, and her religion pure and
                        undefiled. England has been rich in heroic women, but surely none so
                        commands our admiration, so kindles our veneration, so exalts us in thinking
                        it was our nation she graced, as Rachel Wriothesley, wife of Lord William
                        Russell.</p>
