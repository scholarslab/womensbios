      An educational dialogue by the celebrated, first &ldquo;Mrs. Judson," according to some library records. Anne Judson is the
      subject of the last chapter, and so perhaps there would have been more incentive for anonymity.  The Preface
      begins with the idea of biography as example especially influential on the young female.  Judson disclaims
      originality; the biographies derive from existing records.  Because some women are dangerous models, she selects and 
      shapes the narratives for good effect on readers while avoiding allusion
      to sectarian differences (all are "Christians").  According to custom, she apologizes for necessary limits on the selection.  The Introduction
      consists of a dialogue between a daughter, Mary, and her mother "Mrs. G." (presumably the same as Mrs. Grenville in the opening
      chapter) relating an anecdote about a man who gave a boy a biography of Benjamin Franklin because it had such an influence on
      his own life.  "Are there no histories of good and great women, mother?" (xiv).  The mother plans a weekly evening sewing circle
      of young girls to which she can read aloud selectively, with moral annotation, the appropriate model lives of women (as some historic women are
      misleading guides for the kind of daughter she would wish to raise).  Mrs. Grenville gathers "engraved portraits" as well
      as biographies for this book club (no illustrations appear in the Google Book version). An interesting passage depicts Mary
      arranging the parlor for guests, tending her house plants and placing flowers. The first evening, each girl is catechised on the kind of woman she wants to be, and Mrs. G. affirms that
      they do not all need to follow the same model, but all should be devout, and any learned accomplishment should be accompanied
      by good housekeeping skills (here an apt quotation of Hannah More).  The chapters follow the series of supposed evening meetings.  There
      is no table of contents (though running headers name the women).  Mrs. G. comments on the shift from historical grandeur to
      examples that her auditors might plausibly emulate.  One evening is dedicated to Elizabeth Smith, born near Durham, England, in 1776; remarkable for learning (a translator); exemplary for her
      good cheer and resourcefulness when her family loses its wealth (as happens more frequently in America); known as resident of Coniston
      and subject of a poetic tribute and a biography after her death of tuberculosis.  The following evening on the poet Davidson explicitly
      compares the two women, though favoring the latter for her productivity in poetry (examples given).  Mrs. Graham
      was stranded as a widowed mother, during Revolutionary War, in Antigua; became a philanthropist in New York.  Mrs. Judson's life takes up
      the final, eighth evening, with a concluding summary of the examples reviewed.</p>
