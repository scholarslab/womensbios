<p class="" id="N1109E_p">Preceding her canonization in 1920, the Victorian era experienced a revived interest in
                        the historical figure Joan of Arc.
                        Because the biographical accounts written at the time reflect the various
                        ideologies of the age, one doesn&rsquo;t know what to expect of her portrayal. Was
                        she illustrated as a divinely inspired prophetess or simply an imaginative
                        heroine? Universally, they regale her with flowery prose, depicting her as
                        an archetypal tragic heroine who is wronged by her contemporaries; however,
                        it seems that Victorian authors are unable to agree on the extent of her
                        holiness. Her secular self takes a back seat with her &ldquo;divinity&rdquo; pushed
                        beneath the spotlight in some instances, and in others the case is reversed.
                        Also, some authors comment on her adopting male conduct, wearing men&rsquo;s

                        outright what they feel to be appropriate behavior of a member of the
                        &ldquo;fairer sex,&rdquo; while others neglect the issue entirely. These discordant

                        social issues prominent during the Victorian era.</p>
<p class="">Joan of Arc was born in the French village Domr&eacute;my to Jacques d&rsquo;Arc
                        and Isabelle Rom&eacute;e in 1412. Although sources
                        generally portray her childhood as a happy one, the context of Joan&rsquo;s upbringing was both chaotic and
                        violent. The French and the English were entangled in the Hundred
                        Years&rsquo; War, an international conflict that would ultimately determine the
                        future king of France. After 341 years
                        of rule, the royal family line of the Capetians ended in 1328 leaving the French throne unoccupied. In a desperate
                        attempt to assume the throne amidst the controversy concerning the
                        establishment of a legitimate heir, the French and the English entered
                        a war that would last for over a century. Charles VI, during
                        one of his bouts of insanity, had signed the Treaty of Troyes which ensured English claim
                        to the French throne. Charles
                            VII, the Dauphin, came to be seen as an illegitimate heir, while
                        the infant Henry VI became the King of France in 1422. Those still loyal to Charles
                            VII, however, would continue their hostile resistance against English occupation.</p>
<p class="">Joan of Arc claimed to have experienced
                        visions from the time she was twelve, one of which included images of
                            Saint Michael, Saint Catherine and Saint
                            Margaret instructing her to rid France of the English and
                        restore the Dauphin to the throne. The means by which Victorian authors
                        attempt to explain this phenomenon are far from unanimous. For example,
                        while biographer Lord Ronald Gower continuously refers to
                            Joan&rsquo;s &ldquo;presences&rdquo; as visions, John Maskelyne
                        refers to them as mere &ldquo;hallucinations&rdquo; and &ldquo;illusions,&rdquo;
                            (Maskelyne, 235). Biographer William Adams is
                        caught in the same dilemma, portraying the young Joan as an impressionable child who was simultaneously directed
                        by God (Adams, 245-247).</p>
<p class="">In response to her visions, at sixteen years of age Joan requested that she be brought to
                            Count Robert de Baudricourt so that she might earn
                        permission to visit Charles VII at the royal court of Chinon. (She would have to be escorted
                        across enemy territory for the encounter with the Dauphin to take place). On
                        her second attempt she won the Count&rsquo;s approval, as she managed to
                        accurately predict the result of the Battle of the Herrings.</p>
<p class="">News of Joan&rsquo;s visit spread quickly;
                        therefore, to test her divinity Charles dressed himself in
                        commoner&rsquo;s clothing and adorned another in rich garb to mislead her. When
                        she arrived at court, however, she knelt before Charles instead
                        of the decoy, and despite Charles' denials, declared him the
                        true Dauphin: &ldquo;&lsquo;In God&rsquo;s name it is not they, but you, who are the King.
                        Most noble Dauphin, I am Jeanne the Maid.
                        The Heavenly King sends me to help you and the realm; and to tell you that
                        you shall be anointed and crowned in the city of Rheims, and that you shall reign as lieutenant of the Heavenly
                        King, who is the King of France&rsquo;&rdquo;
                            (Adams, 250). Pulling him aside for a private
                        discussion&mdash;although there is no record of what was actually exchanged&mdash;she
                        managed to convince him to allow her to lead his army against the English.</p>
<p class="">After having been granted permission to assist in the command of the French army, Joan deviated from traditional French tactics of war and managed a series of victories against
                        the English, acquiring the fortress of
                            Saint Loup on May 4, 1429,
                        the fortress of Saint Jean le Blanc on
                            May 5, the fortress of Saint
                            Augustins on May 6, and on May 7 the Orleans stronghold les Tourelles (an
                        achievement that left her with a wounded neck). She had another string of
                        victories in the month following, reclaiming Jargeau on June 12, Meung-sur-Loire on June 15, and Beaugency on June 17. She also had success
                        in the June 18 Battle of Patay, which would be the turning point of the Hundred Years&rsquo; War,
                        granting France the lead against England. As a result of her success in
                        battle, she was able to accomplish one of the primary aims of her mission:
                        the coronation of Charles VII in Rheims on July 17.</p>
<p class="">Throughout sieges, captures, and even King Charles&rsquo; coronation,
                            Joan wore the attire of a male
                        knight. Although the French had
                        tolerated Joan&rsquo;s style of dress in her
                        campaigns, it seems that Victorian authors were unable to agree on whether
                        her transvestitism&mdash;and in a few cases her military leadership&mdash;was
                        appropriate. After having described the coronation at Rheims, one particular author remarks: "as the grand
                        object of her mission was now, by the will of Heaven, accomplished, she
                        entreated his permission to return home, and resume those occupations and
                        that course of life which became her sex&rdquo; (James, 34-35). Like
                        other biographers, although he issues abundant praise for Joan&rsquo;s service to her country, he still
                        adheres to Victorian ideology concerning the distinction between gender
                        roles. Another example is Gower&rsquo;s reconstruction of Joan&rsquo;s character during her trial,
                        reaffirming the Victorian perception of women as members of the fairer and
                        weaker sex: &ldquo;Even Joan of Arc&rsquo;s courage
                        failed at that sight, and all the woman in her nature asserted itself&rdquo;
                            (Gower, 232). Gower also notes that she &ldquo;had
                        not the defect of so many excellent but tedious women, who love talk for the
                        mere sake of talking&rdquo; (6). Other biographical accounts convey the opposite,
                        disregarding expectations of women and depicting her solely as a beacon of
                        unconquerable strength (Adams, 253).</p>
<p class="">Joan was one of the last to leave the
                        battlefield of Compi&egrave;gne, resulting in her
                        imminent capture on May 23rd, 1430. She had led a successful
                        attack against the Burgundians until the
                            English intervened and attacked the
                        rear guard. Apparently, she would have made it to safety had not the
                        drawbridge to the heavily fortified town of Compi&egrave;gne been raised at the very last minute. She and a few of
                        her closest aides stranded outside with her were promptly taken as prisoners
                        to Margny, the Burgundian camp. Strangely, according to
                            Gower, Joan had at
                        certain instances demonstrated that she might have known about her fate
                        beforehand:</p>
<p class="">&lsquo;My children and dear friends, I bid you to mark that I have been sold and
                        betrayed and that I shall be shortly put to death. So I beseech you all to
                        pray to God for me, for never more shall I be able to be of service to the
                        King or to the Kingdom of France&rsquo;
                            (Gower, 126).</p>
<p class="">This appears to be another confirmation of her divinely inspired nature, as
                        portrayed by select Victorian biographers. Gower also makes a
                        curious statement that reflects the tendency to expound upon the &ldquo;essence&rdquo;
                        of the biographical subject: &ldquo;This story, whether authentic or not, is
                        surely a touching one, is full of the spirit of the heroine,&rdquo;
                            (Gower, 126). Authenticity is not as important a factor as
                        &ldquo;the spirit of the heroine,&rdquo; quite clearly. Any detail, as long as it
                        eulogizes the subject in some way, is worthy of documentation.</p>
<p class="">The trial, which took place in Rouen from
                            March 26 to May 24, 1431, was conducted by
                            Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais and was preceded by an interrogation lasting over fifteen
                        sessions. During interrogation, Joan was
                        rigorously questioned about her birth, her religious upbringing, her
                        visions, her manly garb, her military actions and even her virginity.
                        Throughout the trial, Joan famously
                        refused to swear an oath concerning the truthfulness of her answers to the
                        judges: &ldquo;You may ask me questions on which I shall be able to answer you,
                        and others about which I cannot&rdquo; (Gower, 158). After
                        interrogation Joan of Arc was forced to
                        endure torture locked in an iron cage for fifty days and nights.
                        Nevertheless, she retained a great deal of dignity and mental clarity,
                        speaking shrewdly and firmly in her defense. Her courage is certainly
                        exalted in Victorian biography; for every factual detail there is a comment
                        on her virtue and bravery. In one instance, Gower exclaims,
                        &ldquo;Glorious words, worthy of her who spoke them! They bear with them a heroic
                        ring, and reveal with one sublime expression the very soul and spirit of
                            Joan of Arc!&rdquo; (192). Rousing,
                        majestic expressions like &ldquo;sublime&rdquo; and &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; add to the already
                        larger-than-life qualities attributed to her. Her noble character is
                        contrasted with those of her captors, who are depicted as dastardly and
                        devoid of morals: &ldquo;No doubt can be entertained that she was a sacrifice to
                        jealousy, in the first place, leaving hypocrisy and cruelty to do their part
                        in the course of her trial--that mockery of justice and everlasting disgrace
                        to all who bore a part in it&rdquo; (James, 43). This line
                        illustrates the sharp polarization of good and evil in these Victorian
                        accounts. The sweeping descriptions &ldquo;sacrifice to jealousy&rdquo; and &ldquo;everlasting
                        shame and infamy&rdquo; have a sense of permanence that coincides with the
                        prevalent religious overtone. There seems to be a clear delineation between
                        the holy and the blasphemous.</p>
<p class="">The conclusion to the dramatic trial was her iconic, romanticized execution.
                            Joan of Arc was condemned to burn at
                        the stake on May 30, 1431, only six days after the trial ended.
                        She was bullied into signing an abjuration stating that she would either
                        wear women&rsquo;s clothes or immediately burn at the stake. She was sexually
                        assaulted only days after the abjuration and the perpetrators stole her
                        clothes and left her with nothing to cover herself but men&rsquo;s attire. When
                        the Bishop noticed her garb, he immediately called for a meeting at the
                        archiepiscopal chapel on the 29th of May in which all condemned
                        her to death.</p>
<p class="">She died beautifully, firmly clutching a crude cross made of staves as the
                        flames consumed her. Of course, Victorian biographers capitalized on the
                        dramatic nature of her death, by exaggerating her heroic and Christ-like
                        characteristics: &ldquo;The crime of her martyrdom will ever rest, and surely no
                        other crime but one in the world&rsquo;s history can be paralleled with it&rdquo;
                            (Gower, 252). Yet not all of them are overwhelmed by
                        religious overtones. Biographer George James, for example, is a
                        lot more secular in his approach: &ldquo;In an enlightened age, her transcendently
                        noble qualities, which were displayed in the best of causes, the just
                        defence of her king and country, would have secured her universal admiration
                        and gratitude; nor perhaps, can ancient or modern history furnish an example
                        of such pure and exalted heroism&rdquo; (James, 62). This text in
                        particular focuses on her personal bravery and attitude rather than her
                        divinity. Also, the author takes the opportunity to opine on the superiority
                        of his own enlightened era, and does not refer to any form of spirituality.
                        The biographies&rsquo; dissonant portrayals of Joan as either a heroic or divine figure (and in some instances
                        a blend of the two) echo the conflict between faith and secularism prominent
                        in Victorian society.</p>
<p class="">From the differing depictions and viewpoints of these biographies, one can
                        easily observe the extent to which Victorians diverged from one another in
                        social ethics and belief systems. Joan of
                            Arc, a focused straightforward character, is poked and prodded in
                        multiple directions by these authors. To some she is a true messenger of
                        God, and to others she is merely a brave soul with an excitable imagination.
                        Their biographies hold up a looking glass to an age when people simply could
                        not decide whether to be spiritual or enlightened, whether to enforce gender
                        roles or to blur the lines. However, these accounts undividedly devote
                        themselves to eulogizing Joan and making
                        it abundantly clear that her nature and deeds were to be venerated by
                        all.</p>
