<p class="" id="N16CA9_p">She carried the light of civilization into the darkest
                        corner of the world, it seemed. For those at home reading of the heroic
                        service of Ann Hasseltine
                            Judson, the first celebrated female American missionary, it
                        was an ideal sacrifice: to leave home and venture into this darkness armed
                        with true belief. The work of spreading Christianity exposed
                        her to disease, starvation and bodily suffering before she died in Burma. In biographies written during
                            the latter half
                        of the nineteenth century, Mrs.
                            Judson becomes a contemporary,
                        realist saint, her martyrdom "magnanimous and sublime," her
                        career a public distinction (Clement, 52). Her
                        devotion to the noble cause of saving souls modeled a new way women could
                        participate in heroic work outside of the home, though memorials often frame
                        Ann's ministry as the helpmeet of her missionary husband,
                            Adoniram Judson. George Hervey writes:
                            "As the life of Mrs. Ann Hasseltine Judson was completely
                            identified with that of her heroic husband, it has been thought neither
                            desirable nor possible to contemplate them altogether apart"
                        (277). Yet, in Burma, surrounded by strangers, Ann would face her most
                        significant trials apart from her husband, bereft of his protection and in
                        fact, protecting him. </p>

<p class="">Ann Hasseltine was born on December 22,
                            1789 in Bradford, Massachusetts
                        to John and Rebecca Hasseltine. There is little factual information
                        known about Ann's childhood; the biographies conclude that she was not remarkably
                        different from other girls her age. This common beginning makes her an
                        accessible model of the heroic distinction <em>any</em> girl
                        can attain with resolve. Walter Wyeth's
                        memorial, written over sixty years after Ann's death, reintroduces her story
                        to public attention in order to inspire a missionary impulse
                        in readers. Yet Wyeth suggests she did not begin as a person to emulate:
                            "She cannot be said to have been a genius, and no example may be
                            made of her in this respect to help or hinder any young person who reads
                            the story of her youth" (12). Such ordinariness might stand in
                        the way of the role-modeling purpose of her story. Instead, it allows the
                        reader to recognize herself in the heroine and imagine taking the same steps
                        that led to a distinguished name in history. As S.W. Williams,
                        the editor of a contemporary collected biography notes:</p>
<p class="block">
                        Biography is at once the most
                            useful and the most entertaining species of literature. It is a mirror
                            into which all may look and see more or less clearly the reflection of
                            their own images...the history of one is the possible history of all.
                            (preface)
                    </p>
<p class="">Commendable examples become most effective through such mirroring between the
                        inspirational figure and the more common reader.</p>
<p class="">As a young adolescent, Ann enjoyed the amusements and entertainments that
                        most lively girls her age pursue. Her disposition was active and restless,
                        such that her mother described it as "rambling" (qtd. in Knowles, 5). However, she also showed self-discipline when it
                        was required of her, and applied herself assiduously to her  studies at Bradford Academy. In her aptitude for
                        learning and dedication to mental improvement, education was the first
                        sphere in which Ann markedly stood out from her peers. Following a favorite
                        method in collective biography of reading gleams of a heroine's future
                        greatness in her developmental years, Frank
                            Goodrich focuses on her determined approach to education:
                            "Here [at Bradford Academy] she first displayed those qualities
                            which so distinguished her in later life&mdash;strength of mind, precision of
                            thought, and indefatigable perseverance" (343-4). Ann
                        Hasseltine&rsquo;s earnest self-improvement, in Goodrich&rsquo;s account, implies that a reader
                        similarly detemined might rise to eminence from the common level.</p>
<p class="">Though biographies agree on the portrait of a remarkably dedicated student,
                        the young girl was nevertheless attracted by the worldly pleasures her peers
                        enjoyed&mdash;balls, plays, assemblies, and the company of admiring young men. In her
                            journal, she acknowledged her own dissipation: the concerns of her
                        toilet for the evening's diversions took precedence over moral
                        self-reflection. Goodrich suggests  that she threw herself
                            into these pastimes as if knowing she would soon renounce them:</p>
<p class="block">Her gaiety so far surpassed that of her friends, as to suggest a
                        vague apprehension that she had but a short time in which to pursue her
                        career of folly, and would be suddenly cut off. (344)</p>
<p class="">Here there is a prediction of another favorite trope in a heroine's
                            narrative&mdash;the
                            moment of redirection or conversion from sinful pursuits onto an
                            unwavering path toward greatness.Wyeth takes full advantage of this method in biography:</p>
<p class="block">One having a volatile disposition may do otherwise than run
                        in the way of evil, and with alacrity may pursue the good; and a habit of
                        vivacious conduct, <em>when sanctified</em>, will be
                        productive of virtuous deeds to a surprising extent. (14, emphasis
                        added)</p>
<p class="">A noteworthy detail in many
                            accounts of the dissipated phase of Ann Hasseltine&rsquo;s
                        development ties her to another heroine celebrated in the annals of
                        collected biography: Ann was said to have received the first conscious glimpse
                        of the eternal peril in which she had placed her soul when she incidentally
                        picked up <a href="featured%3Fid=HANNAH_MORE.html">Hannah
                            More's</a>
                        <span class="subtitle ">
                            <em>Strictures on Female Education</em>
                        </span> and her eyes providentially fell upon a quote from the
                            Bible:"She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she
                            liveth" (qtd. in Wyeth, 16). The repetition of this detail
                        exposes the mechanics of the mirroring technique biographers use: Ann's
                        introspection is sparked by something she reads, modeling the effect her own
                        story is intended to have upon the reader of a collected biography. While
                        this incident was not an instantaneous moment of conversion for Ann (she had
                        several relapses into pleasure-seeking), it is significant for revealing the
                        work being done behind the biography in terms of crafting patterns for other
                        women to follow.</p>
<p class="">The conversion narrative also serves as a means
                        for biographers to do away with any unfitting characteristics present in
                        youth, which, retained into adulthood, would undermine her example as a
                        heroine. Thus Wyeth writes:</p>
<p class="block">When Miss Hasseltine became a subject of the Spirit's work, her nature was as
                        fully moved as  previously when some suggestion of earthly
                        pleasure was presented. Even more, for she was susceptible to an influence
                        of a high character in greater degree than she was to any one of inferior
                        origin. (14)</p>
<p class="">So
                        complete was the conversion that Ann herself becomes, in turn, "an influence
                        of a high character" for the readers of her biography. Some biographies
                        don't acknowledge her youthful folly&mdash;in these works, she was always already
                        an infallible paragon, though at first waiting to discover the avenue for
                        her heroic work. At age seventeen, this avenue was paved by religion: Ann
                            "publicly
                            professed herself a disciple of Christ" when she became a member of
                        the Congregational Church in
                            Bradford on September 14,
                            1806 (Goodrich, 345).</p>
<p class="">Another sign
                        of Ann's development towards the work of Christian ministry for which she
                        would become famous is signaled early in 1807, when she started
                        a school for local children. She
                        instructed them in the manner of her own education and also tried to impart
                        to them the importance of leading a religious life. On the first
                        day she taught, Ann began class by reading aloud a prayer, "astonishing the little creatures by such a beginning, as probably some
                            of them had never heard a prayer before" (qtd. in Goodrich, 346).
                        Soon, she was teaching children from other towns, traveling to hold classes
                        in Salem, Haverhill and Newbury (Goodrich,
                        346). By exporting her efforts to educate others in
                        Christianity, she prefigured her later missionary work. Similarly, Ann's
                        biographer in the collected work <span class="subtitle ">
                            <em>Queenly Women, Crowned and Uncrowned</em>
                        </span>, states:</p>
<p class="block">It was well said of her that the zeal which made
                        her a missionary abroad first made a missionary of her at home...On the Sabbath it was her
                            custom to fix her mind upon some one of her friends, take their arm,
                            and, as they walked home from Church, endeavor to stir them up to seek
                            Christ. (58)</p>
<p class="">The missionary impulse in Ann was stirred&mdash;in a short time, it would not be
                        friends whom she engaged to seek Christ, but strange "heathens" (a term
                        ubiquitously used during the imperialist
                            era) in the distant land of Burma. </p>
<p class="">In 1810, America did not yet
                        have an organized Society to promote foreign mission work, although several
                        Christian associations already existed to spread the gospel in remote parts
                        of the United States. In June of that year, the General Association of Massachusetts (Congregational)
                        met in Bradford. Adoniram
                            Judson,
                        a Seminary student and member of the Third
                            Congregational Church in Plymouth, came to this meeting to petition the Association for its support of a foreign
                            missionary cause. As a result of this petition, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions
                        was created and Judson along with three other men were granted a missionary
                        designation to India. During this
                        meeting in Bradford, a dinner was held for the ministers at Mr. Hasseltine's
                        house; Judson was present and
                        Ann waited on the table (Wyeth, 30). From this first encounter, a strong
                        attachment grew between them and Judson soon sought her hand in marriage, a
                        proposal that also asked Ann to
                            join him in foreign mission work. Acknowledging the danger in which
                        she would be placed, Judson wrote a letter to Mr. Hasseltine, asking:</p>
<p class="block">Whether
                            you can consent to part with your daughter early next spring, to see her
                            no more in this world; whether you can consent to her departure for a
                            heathen land, and her subjection to the hardships and sufferings of a
                            missionary life; whether you can consent to her exposure to the dangers
                            of the ocean; to the fatal influence of the southern climate of India;
                            to every kind of want and distress; to degradation, insult, persecution,
                            and perhaps a violent death. (qtd. in Bolton, 278)</p>
<p class="">The sacrifice laid bare in this letter shows the religious zeal felt by all
                        parties&mdash;parents who would accept this fate for their daughter, a young woman
                        who would knowingly subject herself to such trials a world away from the
                        family and home of her childhood. However, there was also a conflict of
                        interests apparent in the hasty engagement, which took place only three months after they
                            first encountered each other at Mr. Hasseltine's dinner table.
                        In her
                            journal, Ann expressed concern that her attachment to Adoniram would sway her to become a
                            missionary&mdash;a commitment that should be motivated by a calling to
                            religious duty, not by feelings of personal affection.</p>
<p class="">She became
                        convinced that divine will had presented her with the means to carry out a
                        missionary impulse she had felt independently since her own conversion.
                        Accepting his proposal and the fate that awaited her in a heathen land,
                            Ann
                        married Adoniram Judson on February 5, 1812. It was an
                            unprecedented decision to leave America and journey with her husband to
                            a part of the world unknown and terrifying to the imagination. Her
                        conviction that God's hand was guiding her helped Ann to quell the fears she
                        expressed in her journal:</p>
<p class="block">Were it not for these considerations,
                                I should, with my present prospects, sink down in
                            despair, especially as no female has to my
                            knowledge ever left the shores of America to spend her life among the
                            heathen; nor do I yet know that I shall have a single female
                            companion. (qtd. in Goodrich, 348)</p>
<p class="">Public opinion at that time was opposed to such a calling for a woman:
                            "It was deemed wild and
                            romantic in the extreme, and altogether inconsistent with prudence and
                            delicacy" (Wyeth, 31). Ann Judson recognized that she placed
                        herself apart from prudent and delicate women&mdash;from any female peers&mdash;who
                        might confine their work to charitable visiting in the parish. Ann's belief
                        that God had directed her to this higher calling was labeled as a
                            "delusion" (Wyeth, 35) by some&mdash;just as her religious zeal
                        was derided as the "wild and romantic" (31) fantasy of an
                        impressionable and enamored young woman. However, the reality she faced in
                        Burma fully tested her faith: Ann would come home once for the sake of her
                            health; yet, she returned to the mission with as much zeal as she
                        had the first time, not then knowing the hardships that awaited her.
                            Biographies written after her death and memorials
                        that sought to revive missionary spirit laud her true courage and faith in a
                        work that paved the way for women who felt called to a similar duty.
                            These
                        biographies also register the evolution in public opinion; by the end of the nineteenth century women's
                        engagement in wider fields of public work had become far more
                        acceptable.</p>
<p class="">The couple left for India only
                            two weeks after their wedding, sailing on February 19,
                            1812.
                        This sudden and monumental change distressed Ann, who wrote in her journal
                        about the pain of leaving her family and home:</p>
<p class="block">My heart bleeds. O America, my native land! Must I leave thee? Must I
                            leave my parents, my sisters and brother, my friends beloved, and all
                            the scenes of my early youth? Must I leave thee, Bradford, my dear
                            native town, where I spent the pleasant years of childhood; where I
                            learnt to lisp the name of my mother? (qtd. in Bolton, 279)</p>
<p class="">In Burma, she would learn a different language altogether. The four-month
                        voyage at sea tested her endurance for a life that guaranteed hardships. At
                        least one other female did accompany Ann: Harriet
                            Newell,
                        wife of missionary Samuel Newell, though the party split ways
                        upon arrival in India. Both left America together; however, Ann was the first to commit herself to
                        the missionary work of spreading the Gospel amongst the native people. But
                        her friend would be the first to die in the service of this Christian
                        calling, succumbing to illness, along with her newborn child, only a few
                        months after arriving on land. In the pattern of modeling that collected
                        biographers reproduce, several writers held Harriet up as
                            "the proto-martyr of American missions" (Goodrich, 350;
                        Wyeth, 4).</p>
<p class="">Even before arriving at their final destination, Ann encountered situations
                        that were completely alien to the experiences of her former life. Biographers
                        relate versions of the following account from her journal that vividly notes
                        the contrast from her comparatively uneventful years in Bradford:</p>
<p class="block">On one occasion, Mrs. Judson was
                            compelled to take a boat, rowed by six natives...The river was rough,
                            the sun scorching hot, and Mrs. Judson entirely
                            alone, in the midst of men who could administer no other comfort than
                            might be contained in the words, "Cutcha pho annah sahib"...The daughter of New England
                            parents, the pupil and preceptress of a Massachusetts seminary, at the
                            age of twenty-three years, upon a Hindoo river, in a Calcutta boat
                            manned by Hoogly watermen. . .Such a picture of the vicissitudes of life
                            certainly belongs to that volume which treats of the truth that is
                            stranger than fiction. (Goodrich, 352-3)</p>
<p class="">Worth noting is Goodrich's emphasis on the
                        language barrier. Just as the above account ties the ability to comfort (the
                        native phrase translates to "Never fear, madam, never fear") to the ability to communicate,
                        the missionaries would have to learn the native language before they could
                        preach the Gospel's message of saving grace. In July of 1813,
                        when they arrived in Rangoon, Burma,
                        the site where the mission was established, the first thing the Judsons set
                        about doing was to learn the language so they could translate the Bible,
                        write religious tracts and minister to the natives in their own tongue.
                        Adoniram apparently excelled in acquiring the formal grammatical structure
                        of the difficult language; after three years he had written a religious
                        tract in Burmese. Ann, who was more immersed in the daily lives of the
                        native women, learned the conversational dialect more quickly than her
                        husband and by 1817 had begun to read the Bible to a small
                        group of women on the Sabbath (Goodrich, 354-8). Her relative ease in
                        communication would serve her well later, when she would have to plead with
                        Burmese authorities to spare her husband's life. </p>
<p class="">The image of Ann, alone, surrounded by strangers and navigating into the
                        unknown, repeatedly appears in biographies. Frank
                            Goodrich provides a rather fantastical example in the collective
                        biography <em>World Famous Women</em>; before embarking for
                        Rangoon:</p>
<p class="block">Mrs.
                        Judson, knowing that there was not a single European female in all Birmah,
                        [sic] engaged an Englishwoman at Madras to
                        accompany her. By a strange fatality, and as if Mrs. Judson was
                        providentially destined to share alone with her husband the glories and
                        perils of the Birman mission, this woman fell dead upon the deck as the
                        vessel weighed anchor. (354)</p>
<p class="">By another
                        strange occurrence&mdash;the first of a number of hardships faced alone&mdash;Adoniram
                        went missing for over seven months when the boat he was traveling
                        in was blown off-course. While he was gone, the Burmese government began to
                        persecute foreign teachers and the mission house in Rangoon was targeted. As
                        the only one present who could speak Burmese, Ann was called upon to act as
                        a diplomat and convince government officials of the mission's peaceful aims.
                        An outbreak of cholera also occurred
                        during her husband's absence, and she saved everyone in the mission house
                        from infection. Due to a conflict that was brewing between England and Burma, ships were leaving Rangoon and Ann was
                        encouraged to go, but she turned back at the last minute in faith that her
                        husband was still alive. Two weeks later he made it back to Rangoon,
                        to the news "that the preservation of the mission had been due to the
                                firmness and
                                fearlessness of his wife" (Goodrich, 358).</p>
<p class="">For their efforts, the Judsons were not able to baptize a native convert
                        until June 27, 1819. In America,  friends were working on their behalf,
                        urging the Baptist Church (the couple had converted from Congregationalists to
                        Baptists) to organize behind the missionary cause, succeeding in
                            1814 with the establishment of the General Missionary Convention of the Baptist
                            Denomination in the United States of America for Foreign Missions&mdash;which
                            later spawned the American Baptist Missionary Union and the Southern
                            Baptist Convention. In 1822, Ann, suffering from
                        extremely poor health, returned on her own to America in order to recover. She spent the winter in
                            Baltimore championing her
                        missionary cause, giving speeches and publishing her book, <span class="subtitle ">
                            <em>History of the Burman Mission</em>
                        </span>. A year later, though not yet fully recovered in health, Ann said
                        goodbye to her friends with a sense of finality, and anxiously returned to
                        Burma. The Judsons found support from their associates back home; however,
                        the Burmese government did not receive these religious intruders as
                        favorably, and public proclamation of the Gospel was restricted. When war broke out in
                                1824 between the Burmese Empire and the English
                            government in India, this tenuous toleration of the foreigners
                        turned into all out persecution. </p>
<p class="">On June
                            8, 1824, Adoniram and several other missionaries were taken
                        prisoner by Burmese officials on suspicion of being spies for the English.
                        They were chained in heavy iron shackles in the notorious "death-prison," and would be held captive in
                        deplorable conditions for nearly two years. Ann relentlessly sought any
                        means she could of protesting their imprisonment, and pleaded with local authorities&mdash;and more
                        directly addressed the sympathies of their wives&mdash;to spare the missionaries.
                        She used the power of monetary persuasion instead of a religious appeal,
                        repeatedly bribing jailers and using gifts to garner favors with the
                        Governor to stay their execution. When officials came to the mission house
                        to confiscate the group's private property, Ann cleverly hid several
                        valuables which she later used as currency to obtain access to the
                        prisoners. Biographies emphasize her ability to rouse pathos
                        through oratory; she used her skill in the native language to disassociate
                        her cause from British military action. To this end, she
                        also adopted the local dress. Much of her heroic success came from being
                        able to diplomatically navigate&mdash;though an outsider and a woman&mdash;through the
                        patriarchal politics in Burma. </p>
<p class="">During her husband's imprisonment, Ann was alone and unprotected.
                        Retrospectively recording the events of this time in a letter to her
                        brother-in-law in America, she writes:</p>
<p class="block">
                        For nearly a year
                            and a half every thought was so entirely engrossed with present scenes
                            and sufferings, that I seldom reflected on a single occurrence of my
                            former life, or recollected that I had a friend in existence out of Ava. (qtd. in Child, 228)
                    </p>
<p class="">On
                            January 26, 1825, Ann gave birth to a baby girl,
                            Maria (a son had been born September 11, 1815,
                        but died eight months later) with
                        no familiar companion present to care for her during labor. When the
                        captives were suddenly forced to march to another prison, Ann, still weak
                        from childbirth, begged the villagers to tell her where they had been taken.
                        With her infant in her arms, she desperately followed her husband, who was
                        near death after walking to the jail in Oung-pen-la. She pleaded for permission to nurse him back to
                        health, and though starving herself, she procured food for Adoniram and the
                        other prisoners. In her
                            weakened condition, Ann fell severely ill during an epidemic of spotted fever and could no
                        longer nurse Maria. Her
                            husband obtained leave to carry their feeble baby through the village,
                            begging nursing mothers to feed his child&mdash;a story which
                            appears frequently in biographies as a scene sure to capture the
                            sympathies of readers.</p>
<p class="">Ann survived, and when the
                            British defeated the Burmese forces, the foreign prisoners were finally
                            released in March of 1826. Her tireless efforts had
                            sustained the men through twenty-one months of captivity. She and
                        Adoniram made plans to begin a new mission in Amherst, Lower Burma, the house and chapel in Rangoon having been destroyed. In
                            July of 1826, he was called upon to make a journey and he
                        left his wife and daughter, expecting to be gone for only three or four
                        months. During this time Ann built a home for the family and two huts where she held school and ministered to the
                        villagers on Sundays (Bolton, 292). Her husband was delayed abroad and
                        before Adoniram returned home, he would receive word that his wife had died.
                            Ann became ill after another outbreak
                            of the fever. She lingered for eighteen days before dying on
                            October 24, 1826, with none but strangers in her company.
                        The final message she left for the man whom she had followed to this fate
                        was a chilling summation of her missionary sacrifice:</p>
<p class="block">Tell the
                                "teacher" that the disease was
                            most violent, and I could not write; tell him how I suffered and died,
                            and take care of the house and things until he returns. (qtd. in
                        Bolton, 293)</p>
<p class="">She was
                        buried in Amherst under a hopia (hope-tree), an emblem that often appears in
                        the background of portraits that were engraved after her death. In
                            April of 1827, two-year-old Maria was laid to rest by her mother's
                        side.</p>
<p class="">The first
                        American woman to dedicate herself to the work of saving "heathens" in the
                            "Orient," Ann Judson was also remembered as a heroine for
                        saving the imprisoned missionaries, a heroic scene from many political
                        conflicts in Europe and America. Goodrich
                        writes: "She seems to have been providentially designed as the <em>ministering angel</em> of the Birman prison"
                        (367, emphasis added). She is praised for her devoted ministry both to the
                        Burmese natives and to her husband while he was held captive. Both she and
                        her husband advocated their cause through writings for religious
                        publications and through lectures on return visits. These representations
                        made them famous and served as a kind of mission back home that arguably had
                        more effect than any efforts abroad. The example she set, imagined as
                        bearing the civilizing torch of Christian grace
                        into dark, foreign spaces, was held up in collective biographies as a model
                        of ministry for other women to follow. The success of this
                        enterprise in biographical patterning is immediately apparent in relation to
                        Ann Judson: after her death, two more women, Sarah Boardman
                            Judson and in turn Emily Chubbuck Judson would
                        directly emulate her missionary footsteps as wives of Adoniram Judson.</p>
