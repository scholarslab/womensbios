<p class="" id="N15B64_p">Agnes Strickland (a writing team that included her sister)
                        entitles her chapter on Elizabeth I
                        "SECOND QUEEN-REGNANT OF ENGLAND AND IRELAND" (Elizabeth's sister Mary being
                        the first). The student of queens cares a great deal about what power the women
                        actually wielded; most were consorts and, far from reigning, found
                        themselves pawns in political chess. Alternatively, most queens encountered
                        conflict between their voluntary liaisons and involuntary matrimony.
                        Strickland's narratives are notable for drawing on contemporary
                        documents.</p>
<p class="block">Queen Elizabeth first saw the light at Greenwich Palace, the favorite
                        abode of her royal parents, Henry Eighth and
                            Anne Boleyn. Her birth is thus quaintly but
                        prettily recorded by the contemporary historian, Hall: "On the
                            7th day of September, being Sunday, between three and four o'clock in
                            the afternoon, the queen was delivered of a fine lady, on which day the
                            duke of Norfolk came home to the christening."</p>
<p class="block">The queen was desirous of nourishing her infant daughter from
                        her own bosom, but Henry, with his characteristic selfishness, forbade it,
                        lest the frequent presence of the little princess in the chamber of her
                        royal mother should be attended with inconvenience to himself. Much of the
                        future greatness of Elizabeth may reasonably be attributed to the judicious
                        training of her sensible and conscientious governess, combined with the
                        salutary adversity, which deprived her of the pernicious pomp and luxury
                        that had surrounded her cradle while she was treated as the heiress of
                        England.</p>
<p class="">Strickland, like most biographers, seeks to account for the subject's
                        character in the parents' principles and early environment. Also like other
                        narrators of biography, Strickland provides a childhood anecdote: "The first
                        public act of Elizabeth's life, was her carrying the chrisome of her infant
                        brother, Edward VI., at the christening solemnity of that prince... when
                        they left the chapel, the train of her little grace, just four years old,
                        was supported by lady Herbert, as, led by the hand of her elder sister, the
                        princess Mary, she walked with mimic dignity, in the returning procession,
                        to the chamber of the dying queen." </p>
<p class="block">All Henry's matrimonial schemes for his children were doomed to
                        remain unfulfilled, and Elizabeth, instead of being sacrificed in her
                        childhood in some political marriage, had the good fortune to complete a
                        most superior education, under the auspices of the good and learned
                            Katharine Parr, Henry's sixth queen.</p>
<p class="block"> During the reign of Edward, her
                        life was tranquil enough&mdash;the most exciting incident during it being the
                        attempt of Lord Seymour, the
                        brother of the Duke of Somerset, the protector, to induce her to marry him,
                        when she was only sixteen years of age.  Certainly the celibacy of the
                        sovereign was not in consequence of a want of suitors; excepting
                            Penelope, never lady was so pursued with matrimonial proposals.
                        Courtenay, Earl of Devonshire, was
                        a second pretender to the possession of her hand; and then followed a
                        proposition that she should unite herself to the king of Sweden.
                        Subsequently, she was successively importuned to wed Philip of Spain, the
                        earl of Arran, the Dukes of Alencon and Anjou, the Archduke Charles a son of
                        the Elector-Palatine, the Duke of Holstein, the Earl of Arundel, Sir William
                        Pickering, and, at last, any body; her parliament promising, in their own
                        name, and that of the people, to serve, honor and obey him faithfully,
                        "whoever he might be." But Elizabeth rejected all their propositions, and
                        asserted and verified in the sequel her intention to die a spinster. For
                        this strange determination, various and contradictory opinions are given. By
                        many writers it is attributed to political objects, not very obvious or
                        intelligible; while others, with more appearance of probability, affirm it
                        to have originated in a conscious corporeal disqualification for the
                        contingencies of matrimony and childbirth.</p>
<p class="">In an extended chain of analogies, Elizabeth is compared to other queens, her
                        elder sister and Mary Queen of Scots in particular. Strickland presumes that
                        Elizabeth is not only physically unsuited to a woman's biological destiny
                        but also mentally, with an "unfeminine mind." Mary's reign brought
                        "ceaseless peril and adversity," but had the opposite of the usual
                        "mollifying" effect; when "the energetic princess... in her turn," came to
                        power, she exercised it with "a far greater extent of hate and cruelty than
                        she herself had ever experienced." This is a standard view of Elizabeth, yet
                        Strickland also admires her subject's resistance to humiliation. "To all the
                        machinations of her enemies to entrap her into some act which might serve as
                        a pretext for her condemnation, she opposed an invincible prudence and
                        discretion." Rather than escape into marriage with the king of Sweden, "she
                        cautiously demanded whether her sister had been made acquainted with it?
                        This inquiry receiving an unsatisfactory reply, she desired that the matter
                        might be formally communicated to Mary, who, though doubtless previously
                        possessed of the knowledge, feigned to thank her for her loyal and dutiful
                        information, and to permit her to decide according to her own inclination."
                        She was diplomatic, too, under religious inquisition, and Strickland
                             quotes a verse enigma that Elizabeth offered
                        "respecting the doctrine of the real presence":</p>
<span class="verse-group "><span class="verse-line">Christ was the Word that spake it,</span><span class="verse-line">He took the bread and brake it,</span><span class="verse-line">And what the Word did make it</span><span class="verse-line">That I believe and take it.</span></span>
<p class="block">This ingenious subterfuge and jargon seems to have completely
                        perplexed and confounded her interrogators, for we do not hear that they
                        renewed their attempts to entrap her into some avowal which might have
                        conducted her to the stake.</p>
<p class="block">We are indebted to the lively pen of Giovanni Michele, the
                        Venetian ambassador, for the following graphic sketch of the person and
                        character of Elizabeth at this interesting period of her life.  "Miladi Elizabeth," says he, "is a lady of great elegance both
                        of body and mind, though her face may be called pleasing rather than
                        beautiful. She is tall and well made, her complexion fine, though rather
                        sallow." Her bloom must have been prematurely faded by sickness and anxiety,
                        for Elizabeth could not have been more than three and twenty at this
                        period." Her eyes, but above all her hands, which she takes care not to
                        conceal, are of superior beauty. In her knowledge of the Greek and Italian
                        languages, she surpasses the queen, and takes so much pleasure in the
                        latter, that she will converse with Italians in no other tongue. She is
                        proud and dignified in her manners; for, though she is well aware what sort
                        of a mother she had, she is also aware that this mother of hers was united
                        to the king in wedlock, with the sanction of the church and the concurrence
                        of the primate of the realm. The queen, though she hates her most sincerely,
                        yet treats her in public with every outward sign of affection and regard,
                        and never converses with her but on pleasing and agreeable subjects."</p>
<p class="">Upon the death of Mary, November
                            17th, 1558, Elizabeth, being
                            then only twenty-five years old, succeeded to the throne. A
                        deputation from the late queen's council arrived at Hatfield to apprise her
                        of the demise of her sister, and to offer their homage to her as their
                        rightful sovereign. Though well prepared for the intelligence, she appeared
                        at first amazed and overpowered at what she heard, and, drawing a deep
                        respiration, she sank upon her knees and exclaimed, "It is the Lord's doing,
                        it is marvellous in our eyes." Eight-and-twenty years afterwards Elizabeth,
                        in a conversation with the envoys of France, spoke of the tears which
                        she had shed on the death of her sister Mary, but she is the only person by
                        whom they were ever recorded.</p>
<p class="">Strickland appears to be persuaded by the portraits of Elizabeth as schemer,
                        in presenting these shows of emotion as inventions on the part of the new
                        queen. Compare, in contrast, the genuine affect attributed to the young
                        Queen Victoria upon her succession, in Carey's account (see FS on Queen
                        Victoria). Strickland neverthless admires Elizabeth as a sovereign, and sets
                        out to educate the reader into a more balanced view of her as woman ruler.
                        Elizabeth was "temperate and generous" in dealing with Catholics, without
                        "vindictiveness to her own previous persecutors. Her toleration was
                        general," and yet she enacted various institutional and ritual reforms that
                        ought to have provoked rebellion if handled by a less skillful monarch. Once
                        crowned, "she confirmed all Edward's statutes relating to religion,
                        appointed herself governess of the Church, and abolished the Mass, and
                        restored the Liturgy.... without any resort to violence" by either side. "To
                        complete fully his estimate of the difficulty of this vigorous and dexterous
                        deed the reader must call to mind the years and sex of the perpetrator of
                        it; and then, however distasteful may be the character of Elizabeth as a
                        woman, he will readily admit that, as a ruler, she must have been endowed
                        with many eminently appropriate qualities and talents."</p>
<p class="">Strickland borrows from a historical source one of her first extended
                        episodes: Lord Bacon's account of a courtier's petition for the release of
                        prisoners, according to custom upon a coronation: "....Elizabeth went to the
                        chapel, and in the great chamber one of her courtiers... besought her with a
                        loud voice, 'That now this good time there might be four or five more
                        principal prisoners released; those were the four Evangelists and the
                        Apostle St. Paul, who had been long shut up in an unknown tongue, as it
                        were, in a prison, so as they could not converse with the common people.'
                        The queen answered very gravely, 'That it was first best to inquire of them
                        whether they would be released or no.'" To Strickland, this repartee is a
                        serious example of Elizabeth's deliberate mode of weighing decisions. She
                        "was always careful to learn whether the people 'would, or no.'" It seems as
                        if Strickland misses the joke that the writers of the gospels cannot be
                        consulted as to their wishes. What preoccupies Strickland is Elizabeth's
                        mixed character: Strickland does not want to seem to commend the queen's
                        entire "career, for many were the despotic acts she afterwards committed,"
                        including burdensome "monopolies and patents" that hampered trade. On this
                        matter, Strickland approves of Hume's reproach that the Russian monarch
                        instituted free trade that Elizabeth resisted: "'So much juster notions of
                        commerce were entertained by this barbarian than appear in the conduct of
                        the renowned queen Elizabeth I." To Strickland, the Elizabeth was motivated
                        by "detestable egotism," wishing to avoid the need to petition Parliament
                        for funds, and thus the need to yield to its wishes; "and selfishly,
                        therefore, she resolved to sacrifice the nation's interests...."</p>
<p class="">"In the year 1559 occurred the commencement of Elizabeth's tyrannical
                        intercourse with the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots. Originally, scarce
                        foundation existed for an animosity which was afterwards, and for so many
                        years, sustained by a sorry feminine spite and vanity." Strickland does hold
                        Mary responsible for openly advertising an intention to challenge
                        Elizabeth's claim to the throne. Mary put "the arms of England...upon all
                        her equipages and liveries.... Elizabeth clearly saw that it was personal to
                        herself, or else, why had it not been perpetrated during the reign of her
                        sister?" This along with "public policy, and religious bias" led Elizabeth
                        to take sides with Scottish Protestants in the "defeat of the Scottish and
                        French Catholics." The ensuing peace treaty commanded Mary "to abstain from
                        wearing the arms of England. But Mary, as long as her husband Francis II.
                        lived, refused to ratify the proceedings of her ambassadors, and though,
                        after his death, she desisted from assuming any longer the arms, she refused
                        to forego her claim to them."</p>
<p class="">This passage on the battling queens curiously leads the Stricklands to
                        pronounce on their method as biographers: "Our purpose is not historical, we
                        merely select for narration such public acts as seem most suited to
                        elucidate the intricate and inconsistent character of this anomalous
                        princess." This is followed by another short paragraph that reveals how much
                        consensus has built up concerning Elizabeth, a biographical corpus that
                        leaves little discretion to the presenter: "The affair of Raleigh and his
                        cloak is universally known, and we shall therefore prefer to relate some
                        incidents connected with her partiality to Leicester, which are not equally
                        generally notorious."</p>
<p class="block">Sir James Melville, the ambassador of Mary at the court of
                        Elizabeth was an observing man, well skilled in the world, and an
                        accomplished courtier. How competent he was for observation the following
                        extracts from his works will show: "The ceremony of creating Lord Robert
                        Dudley Earl of Leicester was performed at Westminster with great solemnity,
                        the queen herself helping to put on his robes, he sitting with his knees
                        before her with great gravity, but she could not refrain from putting her
                        hand in his neck, smilingly tickling him; the French ambassador and I
                        standing by." He subsequently adds, "The queen, my mistress, had instructed
                        me to leave matters of gravity sometimes, and cast in merry purposes, lest
                        otherwise I should be wearied, she being well informed of that queen's
                        natural temper. Therefore, in declaring my observations of the customs of
                        Dutchland, Poland, and Italy, the buskins of the women were not forgot, and
                        what country weed I thought best becoming gentlewomen. The queen said she
                        had clothes of every sort, which every day thereafter, so long as I was
                        there, she changed. One day she had the English weed, another the
                        French, and another the Italian, and so forth. She asked me, which of them
                        became her best? I answered, in my judgment, the Italian dress; which answer
                        I found pleased her well, for she delighted to show her golden colored hair,
                        wearing a caul and bonnet as they do in Italy. Her hair was more reddish
                        than yellow, and curled, in appearance, naturally. She desired to know of
                        me, what colored hair was reputed best? and whether my queen's hair or hers
                        were best? and which of them two was fairest? I answered, the fairest of
                        them both was not their worst faults. But she was ever earnest with me to
                        declare which of them both was fairest? I said that she was the fairest
                        queen in England, and mine in Scotland; yet she appeared in earnest; I
                        answered that they both were the fairest ladies in their countries, that her
                        majesty was whiter, but my queen was very lovely. She inquired which of them
                        was of higher stature? I said, my queen. Then, said she, she is too high,
                        for I myself am neither too high nor too low."</p>
<p class="">Strickland credits this Elizabethan dialogue of vanity, and adds further
                        documentary evidence from other loyalists of Scotland: "In Sir Walter Scott's "History of Scotland," is a passage which records
                        her vanity with such whimsical gravity, that it must be transferred to these
                        pages in his own words:&mdash;'Throughout her whole reign, queen Elizabeth,
                        pre-eminent as a sovereign, had never been able to forbear the assertion of
                        her claims as a wit and a beauty. When verging to the extremity of life, her
                        mirror presented her with hair too gray, and features too withered to
                        reflect, even in her own opinion, the features of that fairy queen of
                        immortal youth and beauty, in which she had been painted by one of the most
                        charming poets of that poetic age. She avenged herself by discontinuing the
                        consultation of her looking-glass, which no longer flattered her; and
                        exchanged that monitor of the toilet, for the false, favorable, and pleasing
                        reports of the ladies who attended her. This indulgence of vanity brought,
                        as usual, its own punishment. The young females who waited upon her, turned
                        her pretensions into ridicule; and if the report of the times be true,
                        ventured even to personal insult, by misplacing the cosmetics which she used
                        for the repair of her faded charms, sometimes daring to lay on the royal
                        nose the carmine which ought to have embellished the cheeks.'" Clearly it
                        does not occur to Strickland to question the mockery of an aging woman or to
                        sympathize with a woman who loses a source of power in the courtly world,
                        her beauty.</p>
<p class="">This biographer accepts the testimony of an enemy's ambassador and an
                        entertaining historian many generations later. Yet she expresses amazement
                        at the contradictions of Elizabeth's undisputed character, even in citing
                        yet another male judge: "Scarcely can it be believed, that the individual
                        exhibited in forms at once so ridiculous and repulsive, can, under another
                        phase, have extorted from even a Jesuit, the following exalted
                        praise:&mdash;'Elizabeth is one of those extraordinary persons, whose very name
                        imprints in one's mind so great an idea, that the noblest descriptions that
                        are given of her are much below it. Never crowned head understood better how
                        to govern, nor made fewer false steps during a long reign. Charles the
                        Fifth's friends could easily reckon his mistakes; but Elizabeth's foes were
                        reduced to invent them for her. Elizabeth's design was to reign, govern, and
                        be mistress; to keep her people in obedience and her neighbors in awe;
                        affecting neither to weaken her subjects, nor to encroach on foreigners, yet
                        never suffering any to lessen that supreme power, which she equally knew how
                        to maintain by policy or by force; for none at that time had more wit,
                        management, and penetration than she. She understood not the art of war; yet
                        knew so well how to breed excellent soldiers, that England had never seen a
                        greater number, or more experienced, than those which existed during her
                        reign. Her conduct in relation to the marriage of herself with the two
                        successive Dukes of Anjou, was in complete accordance with the determination
                        she expressed to Melville, and so many others, "that she was resolved to die
                        a virgin." It is evident that she never had the smallest intention to unite
                        herself to either of them; with regard to the elder duke, the whole
                        negotiation was equally a stratagem both on the part of Catherine and
                        Elizabeth; but with regard to the second, her affections were involved
                        though the object of them was a "very ugly man." The most amusing feature of
                        this grand contention of will between two such illustrious practitioners as
                        the queen-mother of France and the maiden ruler of England is, that each
                        being far too clever to fail, only succeeded by each cheating the other. The
                        purposes of both the arch-deceivers were attained, and both therefore were
                        mutual dupes."</p>
<p class="block">It was observed that after the death of Essex, the people ceased
                        to greet the queen with the demonstrations of rapturous affection with which
                        they had been accustomed to salute her when she appeared in public. They
                        could not forgive the loss of that generous and gallant nobleman, the only
                        popular object of her favor, whom she had cut off in the flower of his days;
                        and now, whenever she was seen, a gloomy silence reigned in the streets
                        through which she passed. These indications of the change in her subjects'
                        feelings towards her are said to have sunk deeply into the mind of the aged
                        queen, and occasioned that depression of spirits which preceded her
                        death.</p>
<p class="">As Strickland adds layers to her collage of Elizabeth's character, the reader
                        feels more that history has moved on than that a story has been narrated.
                        She devotes a short paragraph to the "evil portent," in the queen's eyes, of
                        needing to have her coronation ring removed: over the years it had "grown
                        into her finger," and it had to be "filed off." In the next paragraph,
                        Strickland mentions "the beginning of June," though no year has been
                        specified, no other indication other than Elizabeth's depression and the
                        approach of the next chapter in the book, that the subject's life nears its
                        close. Elizabeth "confided to the French ambassador, Count de Beaumont,
                        'that she was a-weary of life,' and with sighs and tears, alluded to the
                        death of Essex," her obsession. She said, 'that being aware of the
                        impetuosity of his temper and his ambitious character, she had warned him
                        two years before to content himself with pleasing her, and not to show such
                        insolent contempt..., but to take care not to touch her sceptre, lest she
                        should be compelled to punish him according to the laws of England, and not
                        according to her own.... His neglect of this caution,' she added, 'had
                        caused his ruin.'" Nevertheless, the reign and life of the melancholy
                        survivor carry on in Strickland's volume.</p>
<p class="block">One of the members of Elizabeth's household gives the
                        following account of the state of the queen's mind, in a letter to a
                        confidential correspondent, in the service of her successor: 'Our queen is
                        troubled with a rheum in her arm, which vexeth her very much, besides the
                        grief she hath conceived for my lord of Essex's death. She sleepeth not so
                        much by day as she used, neither taketh rest by night. Her delight is to sit
                        in the dark, and sometimes with shedding tears, to bewail Essex.'"</p>
<p class="">Strickland almost seems in the position of lady in literal waiting in the
                        court, tracing the fitful moods of the sovereign. At the same time the
                        biographer might be filing through correspondence: from "fits of
                        despondency... we find Elizabeth exhibiting fits of active mirthfulness,
                        especially at the expense of her dwarfish premier, Cecil.... She sometimes
                        so far forgot the dignity of her age and exalted station as to afford him a
                        sort of whimsical encouragement." This "coquetry" is documented in a
                        courtier's letter "to the earl of Shrewsbury" copying "'some verses
                        compounded by Mr. Secretary, who got Hales to frame a ditty to it. The
                        occasion was, I hear, that the young lady Derby, wearing about her neck and
                        in her bosom, a dainty tablet, the queen, espying it, asked, "What fine
                        jewel that was?" Lady Derby was anxious to excuse showing it; but the queen
                        would have it. She opened it, and, finding it to be Mr. Secretary's picture,
                        she snatched it from lady Derby's neck, and tied it upon her own shoe, and
                        walked about with it there. Then she took it from thence, and pinned it on
                        her elbow, and wore it some time there also. When Mr. Secretary Cecil was
                        told of this, he made these verses, and caused Hales to sing them in his
                        apartments. It was told her majesty that Mr. Secretary Cecil had rare music
                        and songs in his chamber. She chose to hear them, and the ditty was sung.'"
                        The gist of the verse was "'that he repines not, though her majesty may
                        please to grace others; for his part, he is content with the favor his
                        picture received.' This incident took place when the royal coquette was in
                        her seventieth year. Strange scenes are occasionally revealed when the
                        mystic curtain that veils the penetralia of kings and queens from vulgar
                        curiosity is, after the lapse of centuries, withdrawn by the minuteness of
                        biographical research. What a delicious subject for an " H. B." caricature
                        would the stately Elizabeth and her pigmy secretary have afforded!"
                        Strickland impersonally ascribes agency to "biographical research" unveiling
                        penetralia, but misses both the vulgar curiosity in her expose of the pranks
                        and entertainments of historical figures, and the element of caricature in
                        her own portrayal of Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="">Strickland adds further scenes of intrigue. Cecil was double dealing as "the
                        creature of the expecting impatient heir" of the aging queen. "One day, a
                        packet, from King James, was delivered to him....Elizabeth's quick eye,
                        doubtless, detected the furtive glance which taught him to recognize that it
                        was a dangerous missive; and she ordered him instantly to open and show the
                        contents of his letters to her." He played on her fear of disease ("one of
                        her weak points"); 'This packet,' said he, ...' has a strange and evil
                        smell. Surely it has not been in contact with infected persons or goods?'
                        ... she hastily ordered Cecil to throw it at a distance, and not to bring it
                        into her presence again till it had been thoroughly fumigated. He, of
                        course, took care to purify it of the evidence of his own guilty deeds.</p>
<p class="block">The next anecdote, however, goes far beyond all our present
                        discovery in optics: "Afterwards, in the melancholy of her sickness, she
                        desired to see a true looking-glass, which in twenty
                        years before she had not seen, but only such a one as on purpose was made to
                        deceive her sight, which true looking-glass being brought her, she presently
                        fell exclaiming at all those flatterers which had so much commended her, and
                        they durst not after come into her presence." Her attendants had doubtless
                        left off painting her, and she happened to see her natural face in the
                        glass.</p>
<p class="block">A fearful complication of complaints ... began to draw visibly
                        to a climax. She suffered
                            greatly with the gout in her hands and fingers, but was never heard
                        to complain of what she felt in the way of personal pain, but continued to
                        talk of progresses and festivities, as though she expected her days to be
                        prolonged through years to come.</p>
<p class="block">All contemporary writers bear witness to the increased dejection
                        of her mind, after visiting her dying kinswoman, the Countess of Nottingham;
                        but the particulars of that visit rest on historical tradition only. It is
                        said that the countess, pressed in conscience on account of her detention of
                        the ring, which Essex had sent to the queen as an appeal to her mercy, could
                        not die in peace until she had revealed the truth to her majesty, and craved
                        her pardon. But Elizabeth, in the transport of mingled grief and fury,
                        shook, or, as others have said, struck the dying penitent in her bed, with
                        these words, "God may forgive you, but I never can!"</p>
<p class="block">The death-bed confession of the countess of Nottingham gave a
                        rude shock to the fast-ebbing sands of the sorrow-stricken queen.</p>
<p class="block">It is almost a fearful task to trace the passage of the mighty
                        Elizabeth through the "dark valley of the shadow of death." Many have been
                        dazzled with the splendor of her life, but few even of her most ardent
                        admirers, would wish their last end might be like hers.</p>
<p class="">Strickland once again quotes at length from the memoir of a contemporary male
                        courtier: Robert Carey, "afterwards earl of Monmouth," who visited the
                        sickroom of "his royal kinswoman": "'I found her in one of her withdrawing
                        chambers, sitting low upon her cushions. She called me to her; I kissed her
                        hand, and told her it was "my chiefest happiness to see her in safety and
                        health, which I hoped might long continue. She took me by the hand, and
                        wrung it hard, and said, 'No, Robin, I am not well,' and then discoursed to
                        me of her indisposition, and that her heart had been sad and heavy for ten
                        or twelve days, and in her discourse she fetched not so few as forty or
                        fifty great sighs. I was grieved... I never saw her fetch a sigh, but when
                        the queen of Scots was beheaded. Then, upon my knowledge, she shed many
                        sighs and tears, manifesting her innocence that she never gave consent to
                        the death of that queen. I used the best words I could to persuade her from
                        this melancholy humor, but I found it was too deeprooted in her heart, and
                        hardly to be removed. This was upon Saturday night, and she gave command
                        that the great closet should be prepared for her to go to chapel the next
                        morning.'" The next day after much suspense she never emerged but lay upon
                        cushions in the private room to hear the service, and remained on the
                        cushions without eating for days.</p>
<p class="block">Beaumont, the French ambassador, affords a yet more gloomy
                        picture of the sufferings of mind and body, which rendered the progress of
                        the "dreaded and dreadful Elizabeth" to the tomb, an awful lesson on the vanity
                            of all earthly distinctions and glories, in the closing stage of life,
                            when nothing but the witness of a good conscience, and the holy reliance
                            on the mercy of a Redeemer's love, can enable shrinking nature to
                            contemplate, with hope and comfort, the dissolution of its earthly
                            tabernacle.</p>
<p class="block">On the 24th of March, Beaumont made the following report of the
                        state of the departing monarch:&mdash;"The queen was given up three days ago; she
                        had lain long in a cold sweat, and had not spoken. A short time previously
                        she said, 'I wish not to live any longer, but desire to die.' Yesterday and
                        the day before she began to rest, and found herself better after, having
                        been greatly relieved by the bursting of a small swelling in the throat. She
                        takes no medicine whatever, and has only kept her bed two days; before this
                        she would on no account suffer it, for fear (as some suppose) of a prophecy
                        that she should die in her bed. She is, moreover, said to be no longer in
                        her right senses; this, however, is a mistake; she has only had some slight
                        wanderings at intervals."</p>
<p class="">Strickland disputes an account of the way the courtiers knew of Elizabeth's
                        approval of James as her successor, and similarly suggests that the vigilant
                        "spies" about court found it difficult to detect the quiet passing of "the
                        spirit of the mighty Elizabeth." Having said prayers, she fell into a final
                        sleep, "and, about three in the morning, it was discovered that she had
                        ceased to breathe." Here another signal is transmitted, this one a legendary
                        secret code but unmistakable what it portended for Britain. "Lady Scrope
                        gave the first intelligence" of Elizabeth's death "by silently dropping a
                        sapphire ring to her brother, who was lurking beneath the windows." This
                        famous "'blue ring' had been confided to Lady Scrope" for this very purpose.
                        "Sir Robert Carey caught the token, fraught with the destiny of the island
                        empire, and departed, at fiery speed, to announce the tidings in
                        Scotland."</p>
<p class="block">This great female sovereign died in the seventieth year of her
                        age, and the forty-fourth of her reign. She was born on the day celebrated
                        as the nativity of the Virgin Mary, and she died, March 24th, on the eve of
                        the festival of the annunciation, called Lady-day. Among the complimentary
                        epitaphs which were composed for her, and hung up in many churches, was one
                        ending with the following couplet:&mdash;</p>
<span class="verse-group "><span class="verse-line">"She is, she was; what can there more be said?</span><span class="verse-line">On earth the first, in heaven the second maid."</span></span>
