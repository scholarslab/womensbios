<p class="" id="N10A85_p">Rosa Nouchette Carey begins her four-chapter,
                        seventy-seven page biography of "Her Majesty the Queen" with excessive
                        signals of authority. After redundant chapter titles, "Childhood and Youth,"
                        "Victoria the Good," comes an epigraph by Wordsworth, praising
                        the auspicious birth of Victoria. It is actually an
                        excerpt&mdash;ten tetrameter lines of the "Quartet"&mdash;of Wordsworth's
                        "Ode on the Installation of His Royal Highness Prince Albert as Chancellor
                        of the University of Cambridge in 1847," a kind of fairytale musical (15).
                            The "Quartet" ends with Time's prophecy that Victoria will be that rare sovereign who
                            enjoys the blessing of love. Wordsworth's occasional
                            poem, a
                        court masque guided by divine allegories, anticipates the spirit of this
                        ponderous, royalist biography. But this is also a biography set in recent
                        national history, as signalled by a second epigraph, from the
                        historian Thomas Macaulay:</p>

                        historian Thomas Macaulay:</p>
<p class="block">When the time comes for the history of the reign of Queen Victoria to be written, it will be
                        found that no equal epoch since the commencement of the Christian era&mdash;except, perhaps,
                        that which includes the discovery of America, the invention of printing, and
                        the Reformation&mdash;has been so full of important events, affecting the
                        condition and progress of the human race.</p>
<p class="">Macaulay alludes to  the progress of science, technology, "the subjugation
                        of nature to the use of man," and the general advancement of society in
                        education, morals, and religion (15). Victoria's progress is linked to a
                        tradition of the English queen regnant: Carey
                        approvingly cites Lord Macaulay's analogy representing Victoria as "a wiser, gentler, happier
                            <a href="featured%3Fid=QUEEN_ELIZABETH_I.html">Elizabeth</a>" (15-16).</p>
<p class="">Carey continues her exposition of biography's stable conditions
                        and the key life event, birth: </p>
<p class="block">The whole life of our beloved Queen, as
                        we know it up to the present day, is a Royal Idyll, noble in its simplicity,
                        its truth, its purity; and as child, crowned maiden, wife, mother, and
                        widowed ruler, she alike claims our reverence and love.  It was a
                        blessed day for  England, that
                            24th of May, 1819, when in the grey old palace at Kensington the girl baby opened her blue eyes first on this
                            world. The only child of the popular Duke of
                            Kent and his wife, the widowed and charming Princess of Leiningen, great was her father's
                        rejoicing at her birth. 'Take care of her, for she will be Queen of England,' he would
                        say, with fond pride....(16)</p>
<p class="">A tale of royal progress can have the stilted pace of a processional, but the
                        grandeur may be belied by a leveling tendency to include indiscriminate
                        details and to mix emotional registers. The account runs through her
                        information: the baptism of Princess Alexandrina Victoria on  June 24,
                            1819; the infant's distinction as the first British royal person
                        to be vaccinated; the family holiday to Sidmouth, "where the little one
                        thrived in the health-giving Devonshire air; but alas!" her father
                        caught a fatal chill. Carey juxtaposes the father's death with the vitality
                        of the future queen, dwelling on a sentimental anecdote (without
                        attribution): "There is a sweet
                            word-picture here; for we are told that the royal infant, 'being held up
                            at the carriage window to bid the assembled population of Sidmouth
                            farewell, sported and laughed joyously, and patted the glass with her
                            pretty dimpled hands, in happy unconsciousness of her melancholy
                            bereavement.'...how vividly one seems to see it!"(18).</p>
<p class="">
                        As
                        the biography proceeds, the reader will become familiar with Carey's
                        preference for such word pictures, emblems, or narrative paintings
                        contrasting innocent youth with warnings of death; there will be many
                        similar public spectacles of Victoria's emotion. Often the scene seems to
                        value the royal capacity to override the more natural affect of an
                        occasion.</p>
<p class="">Carey almost admits that it is difficult to write an interesting narrative
                        about the living queen, about whom we know everything but may actually have
                        little to say. Thus, on the task of biography, the fifth and sixth
                        paragraphs, each a sentence long:</p>
<p class="block"> As we follow the footsteps of the Royal child from infancy to
                            childhood, and on through her
                        early youth, the curtain seems to rise for us again and again; and
                        some never-to-be-forgotten picture is placed before our eyes&mdash;...rich
                        with nature's verity, and warm with colour. </p>
<p class="block"> Every writer who has striven to pourtray the leading incidents
                        of Queen Victoria's life has seized eagerly on these little
                            episodes, which seem to stand out with cameo-like clearness, and
                        one by one to reproduce them. (18) </p>
<p class="">Each of these cameos hints that it might have been mass produced. How to
                        avoid the effect of a curtain rising again and again? The national audience
                        rehearses and performs sentiments memorized over a collective lifetime of
                        the Queen's reign. But Carey finds it worthwhile to quote anecdotes by
                        eminent witnesses of the royal childhood. "The great philanthropist
                            William Wilberforce writes to <a href="featured%3Fid=HANNAH_MORE.html">Hannah More</a>, on July 21st, 1820" of an invitation
                        to wait on the Duchess of Kent. "'She received me with her fine animated child on
                            the floor beside her with her playthings, of which I soon became one.'
                            The life at Kensington Palace was as simple as that of any English
                            household" (18). The future queen is capable of making fond fools
                        of statesmen, it seems&mdash;or of making a domestic scene a model of the
                        nation. This national home is at once cosy (Princess and mother always share
                        a bedroom) and bucolic (on summer days, they take their simple breakfast
                        outdoors among flowers and birds); run like clockwork, it is an infallible
                        program of self-improvement. Several sources attribute national well-being
                        to the disciplined program that kept Victoria morally in tune, albeit lonely
                        and a bit taxed with surveillance (19). </p>
<p class="">Baroness Lehzen, the governess, plays her part in narratives of
                        Victoria's education. In a
                             letter to the Queen dated December 2nd,
                            1867, the Baroness recalls "'some remarkable words of your
                        Majesty when only twelve years old, while the Regency Bill was still in
                            progress. I
                        then said to the Duchess of Kent that
                        now for the first time your Majesty ought to know your place in the
                            succession.'" The two older women agreed to place the genealogy in
                        the girl's history book, as part of the lesson she was to study. On
                        discovering it, the Princess remarks, "'I see I am nearer the
                        throne than I thought.'" In a moment she continues to her governess,'Now,
                        many a child would boast; ...There is much splendour, but much
                        responsibility.' The Princess, having lifted up the forefinger of her right
                        hand, gave me that little hand, saying, 'I will be good, dear Lehzen; I will
                        be good.'" Lehzen recalls that Victoria said she would be glad if
                        Adelaide (wife of Willim IV) gave birth to an heir in place of Victoria,
                        since the queen was so fond of children. Carey concurs with the queen's
                        former governess that Victoria was promising, in every sense: "One must
                        surely allow that these were remarkable words to be spoken by a child of
                        twelve" (21).</p>
<p class="">A rosy picture of the Duchess of Kent's nurture of a thoroughly English
                        princess cannot hide some conflicts. In a tone that blends biography,
                        history, and fiction for girls, Carey recounts that the Princess was
                        presented at Court on Queen Adelaide's
                        birthday, on February 24th, 1831, but was conspicuously absent
                        at the coronation of William IV. Carey perceives nothing controversial in
                        Parliament's designation of the Duchess of Kent as Regent with annual support
                        totalling &pound;16,000 (22-23), and appears mystified by King William's "painful"
                        outburst against this potential Regency at his own birthday dinner, when he
                        vowed to live long enough to prevent it. William publicly repudiated the
                        Duchess and commanded her daughter in future to "appear at Court on all
                        occasions" (24).</p>
<p class="">If William saw a plot, so does Carey, but unlike the recent film portrayal of
                        "the young Victoria," this Victorian biography has no objection to the
                        extreme control exercised over the royal princess. The romance plot had
                        little suspense, in any case, with mother and uncle working as matchmakers.
                        The Duchess of Kent invited the Duke of Coburg and his sons Ernest and
                        Albert for a visit of "nearly four weeks at Kensington Palace, and the
                        cousins spent delightful days together, playing duets on the piano,
                        sketching, walking and riding, and visiting the chief attractions of the Metropolis," while the young parties
                        supposedly were left to form their own voluntary attachment (24-25). Carey
                        concludes her first chapter when Victoria comes of age in May, 1837, the
                        public celebrations followed quickly by the death of William IV.</p>
<p class="">The second chapter, "Accession and Marriage," begins with two well-known
                        epigraphs by <a href="featured%3Fid=ELIZABETH_BARRETT_BROWNING.html">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>, her praise of "the weeping Queen" who "wept to wear a
                            crown," and a tercet from "A Vision of Poets" on the close association
                            of "church and mart," "dream or grave." Carey meditates on the
                        proximity of death in the happiest of times in life&mdash;"Life and death,
                        buoyant youth and senile decay, and light tripping feet moving with averted
                        eyes among the graves!"&mdash; pointing to the repentant death of William IV
                        as preamble to the rise of the young queen (27). The emblem of corrupt
                        (masculine) age and innocent (feminine) youth was irresistible, as Charles
                        Dickens's <span class="subtitle ">
                            <em>The Old Curiosity Shop</em>
                        </span> suggested in the early days of Victoria's reign
                            (1840-1841).</p>
<p class="">The virgin princess appears in a kind of Annunciation scene and Carey's
                        readers are invited to recall it.  "A Royal Idyll indeed!&mdash;it reads to us still like a
                            fairy tale; we heard it first at our mother's knee" (28). The Angel
                        Gabriel takes the form of court dignitaries, arriving at the palace to wake
                        the Princess to her new calling. Carey quotes "Miss Wynn in her 'Diary of a Lady
                        of Quality'": the Princess "'came into the room in a loose white nightgown
                        and shawl, her nightcap thrown off, and her hair falling upon her shoulders,
                        her feet in slippers, tears in her eyes, but perfectly collected and
                        dignified'" (28). Indeed, Carey shares the public's urge to portray a
                        weeping yet disciplined queen. Victoria's own
                        recollection of the news of her uncle's death is less melodramatic, but
                        emphasizes that she was sent into see the Archbishop of Canterbury and the
                        Lord Chamberlain alone. </p>
<p class="">Carey's Victoria is a model providentially fit for a national destiny, yet
                        full of repressed emotion natural to a young girl.  As a "'multitude of men'"
                        swear allegiance to her in the first Privy Council she performs just the
                        mixture of feelings that should be detected but not expressed: her blush,
                        her occasional glance "'at Melbourne for instruction'" as she appears to
                        ignore protocols of rank, greeting all graciously (Greville quoted in Carey
                        30). After the equivalent of a trial scene, she insists on being left alone
                        in her mother's room for two hours. No one knows, and yet all loyal subjects
                        readily imagine what the Queen was thinking.  "No one dare invade
                        that sacred privacy; but we may believe that that fair young head was bowed
                        in earnest prayer for strength and wisdom to fulfil the duty." The monarch's
                        interior monologue seems to become a meditation on her own title: "'Victoria
                        Regina, by the grace of God, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
                        and Ireland'" (30), yet we are not to imagine she pronounced it aloud. Her
                        letter of condolence to William's widow was addressed to "Her Majesty the
                        Queen": "'I will not be the first person to remind her of it'"
                        (30)&mdash;another of the speeches or reticences displayed like gems
                        on velvet.</p>
<p class="">Carey's narrative follows day by day and hour by hour the test of the new
                            monarch: "On the following morning, June 21st, the
                        Queen, accompanied by her mother, drove in state to St. James's Palace. The
                        guns in the Park fired a salute at ten o'clock, and immediately the 'little
                        Queen' stood at the window of the Presence Chamber in full view of the
                            crowd, while the band of the Royal Guards struck up
                        the National Anthem"; the proclamation is read aloud by the correct
                        functionaries. The collective gaze takes an impression of a sacrificial
                        figure: "The Queen
                            looked very pale and fatigued. She was dressed in deep mourning, with a
                            white tippet, white cuffs, and a border of white lace under a small
                            black bonnet, which was placed far back on her head, exhibiting her
                            light hair in front, simply parted over her forehead. She appeared
                            deeply affected at the acclamations of her people, and was observed to
                            shed tears" (31).
                        <a href="featured%3Fid=ELIZABETH_BARRETT_BROWNING.html">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>
                        reappears in the final stanza of the poem quoted in the epigraph, here
                        offering a blessing that Victoria "will not weep / To wear that heavenly
                        crown" (31).</p>
<p class="">Carey collates the testimony of famous witnesses of the first actions of the
                        new queen. Thus, the celebrated
                            actress Fanny Kemble writes: "The Queen is not
                            handsome, but very pretty, and the singularity of her great position
                            lent a sentimental and poetical charm to her youthful face and figure.
                            The serene, serious sweetness of her candid brow and clear soft eyes
                            gave dignity to the girlish countenance; while the want of height only
                            added to the effect of extreme youth of the round but slender figure,
                            and gracefully moulded hands and arms. The Queen's voice was
                        exquisite, nor have I ever heard any spoken words more musical in their
                        gentle distinctness than 'My Lords and Gentlemen,' which broke the
                        breathless silence of the illustrious assembly, whose gaze was riveted on
                        that fair flower of royalty. The enunciation was as perfect as the
                        intonation was melodious, and I think it is impossible to hear a more
                        excellent utterance than that of the Queen's
                        English by the English Queen."</p>
<p class="">This young woman's every utterance has become performative&mdash;documented
                        and carrying the force of a vow or a law. Thus, Carey recounts Victoria's
                        first of "many deeds of mercy," the pardon of a deserter (32), followed by
                        the resolve of "'sacred duty'": "'I want to pay all
                        that remains of my father's debts,' she said to the Prime Minister" (32).
                            
                            Lord Melbourne,
                         now in loco parentis, devotes himself "to educate, instruct and form
                        the most interesting mind and character in the world," writes George
                        Villiers to Greville, in turn quoted by Carey (33). 
                         With
                        Melbourne's guidance, Victoria "showed that untiring industry and remarkable
                        aptitude for business that was to set such a noble example to her subjects"
                        (33).</p>
<p class="">The girl who vowed to be good institutes a daily routine the nation might
                        safely follow (or envy). Carey quotes an outline of
                        the Queen's day in present tense that shifts to past in Carey's own words:
                        She "'gets up soon after eight o'clock, breakfasts in her own room, and is
                        employed the whole morning in transacting business....and has every matter
                        of interest and importance in every department laid before her. At eleven or
                        twelve Melbourne comes to her and stays an hour, more or less.... At two she
                        rides with a large suite (and she likes to have it numerous); Melbourne
                        always rides at her left hand, and the equerry-in-waiting on her
                        right'"&mdash;a seemingly dogged gallop of state for two hours "along the
                        road"&mdash;followed by "'music and singing, playing and romping with
                        children'" of the court. Dinner convenes at 7:30 but the Queen "seldom
                        appears before eight" (33-34). Victoria "would not allow the gentlemen to
                        remain over their wine more than a quarter of an hour, but always remained
                        standing in the drawing-room until they appeared. Coffee was then served,
                        and after the Royal hostess had said a few words to each of her guests, the
                        Duchess of Kent's whist table was arranged, the round table marshalled,
                        Melbourne always seated at her left hand, and at half-past eleven the Queen
                        retired" (34).</p>
<p class="">Carey's chapter shifts from reiterated actions to discriminated
                            events, the most notable being the Queen's coronation June 28th,
                            1838 and wedding on February 10, 1840, events
                        relished in detail for their pomp, romance, weight. The coronation is "a
                        magnificent and soul-stirring spectacle"; witnesses weep "during the long
                        wearisome ceremonial," and choirboys shout "'Vivat Victoria Regina!,"
                        trumpets, drums, and guns resound, and the Queen and her mother are nearly
                        overcome with emotion. The emotion did not, for some time, extend to a
                        passionate urge to marry Albert.</p>
<p class=""> Carey approves of Victoria's retrospective self-reproach for having kept the
                        prince in suspense for years: Victoria writes, "'The
                            only excuse the Queen can make for herself is in the fact, that the
                            sudden change from the secluded life at Kensington to the independence
                            of her position as Queen Regnant at the age of eighteen, put all idea of
                            marriage out of her mind, which she now most bitterly repents'"
                        (35). But the sight of Albert overcame all resistance.</p>
<p class="">Carey relies on Victoria's letters to King Leopold and Baron Stockmar,
                        statements of private feeling clearly communicating a matter of
                        international political concern. The young woman feels guilty for her recent
                        resolution not to marry, but confesses "'Albert has completely won my heart,
                            and all was settled between us this morning. ... I feel certain he will
                            make me very happy. I wish I could say I felt as certain of making him
                            happy, but I shall do my best'" (36). Prince Albert's own
                        diplomatic letter to his grandmother confirms that the love was mutual;
                        Carey interrupts excerpts of it to exclaim, "Could anything be more idyllic
                        in its simplicity and guileless reality than this betrothal of the 'sweet
                        Flower of May' to the princely Sir Galahad, so true to the motto of his
                        house, '<em>Treu und Fest</em>'" (37).</p>
<p class="">When the princes returned home, Victoria is reported, in correspondence
                        between royal families, to be disconsolate. 
                         Albert wrote to the Duchess of Kent, "'What you
                        say about my poor little bride sitting all alone in her room, sad and
                        silent, has touched me to the heart," and Victoria later reflected on this
                        epistolary consolation: "For 'the poor little bride' there was no lack of
                        those sweet words, touched with the grateful humility of a manly love,...a
                        precious foretaste to her of the happiness of the years to come" (37-38).
                        There are several frames to this quotation of correspondence, Carey quoting
                        the living queen's own written rereading of well-publicized exchanges of
                        feeling years before. The romance was never a private affair. Victoria had
                        to declare her feelings and marital intentions to Government, always
                        manifesting her sensibility as well as her command of the performance. "'I felt
                            my hand shake, but I did not make one mistake,'" she wrote in her
                        journal (38). </p>
<p class="">For a guileless romance, the marriage is excessively procedural; questions
                        must be settled of Albert's title and annuity, the wedding liturgy (to
                        retain the word "obedience"), the wedding gown's Honiton lace, how her train
                        is to be "borne by twelve...daughters of well-known peers" (39).  Witnesses
                        described her attire and her expressions of tearful happiness and
                        "confidence" in the Prince as she
                        uttered the vow. The honeymoon at Windsor, Albert's sad parting from father
                        and brother, the departure of the Duchess of Kent to her own residence in
                        turn bring Carey's narrative to a new phase: "And so the ideal married life
                        began; the maiden monarch no longer stood alone&mdash;she had now a
                        strong arm on which to lean, and a discreet and faithful adviser ever beside
                        her. No one who saw them could doubt that it was a marriage of profound
                        happiness and true sympathy, and the good Queen had her peerless
                            knight&mdash;<em>sans peur et sans reproche</em>" (41).
                        The chapter concludes with quatrains of a supposed song by a Scottish
                        "peasant girl" recalling the  coronation. The tropes of appearance, solitude,
                        national spirit, shared emotion, are all condensed in the pseudo-ballad. </p>
<p class="">Like previous chapters, the third chapter begins with dual
                        titles&mdash;"Married Life" and "Wife and Mother"&mdash;and a prestigious
                        epigraph (this one from Tennyson on the good influence of Victoria as
                        "Mother, Wife and Queen"). The marital happiness of Victoria and Albert
                        counterbalances "the trammels of etiquette and the wearisome routine and
                        burdensome duties of a court"; "the youthful pair set a noble example"
                            in
                        their "industry" as well as "their method of utilising their moments of
                            leisure" (42). As in the depictions of the quasi-pastoral childhood
                        at the palace, Carey imports eyewitness testimony, a letter quoted in a
                        biography of Prince Albert, written by "one of the artists employed in
                        decorating a pavilion in the garden of Buckingham Palace." The
                        artist can attest to Victoria and Albert's superioriity to other royalty for
                        whom he has worked.</p>
<p class="block"> They have breakfasted, had morning prayers with the household
                        in the private chapel, and are out some distance from the Palace, talking to
                        us in the summer-house, before half-past nine o'clock, sometimes earlier.
                        After the public duties of the day and before their dinner they come out
                        again, evidently delighted to get away from the bustle of the world to enjoy
                        each other's society in the solitude of the garden.... Here, too, the royal
                        children are brought out by their nurses, and the whole arrangement seems
                        like real domestic pleasure.</p>
<p class="">Carey confirms this idyll as a
                            reproach to common upper classes: "What an example to those frivolous
                            butterflies of fashion always seeking after pleasure, and frittering
                            away precious time and strength in their search for what they call
                            happiness" (43-44). </p>
<p class="">Abruptly the theme of Victoria's virtues in contrast to "jaded worldlings"
                        (44) leads Carey to the moral improvements of the entire Victorian age. "The
                        Queen's influence on the stage was wonderfully beneficial; as Mrs.
                            Oliphant observes, "she was in the foreground of the national
                            life, affecting it always for good....The theatres to which she went,
                            and which both she and her husband enjoyed, were purified by her
                            presence; evils which had been the growth of years disappearing before
                            the face of the young Queen" (44). The new era then leads Carey
                        back to the biographer's chronological responsibilities.</p>
<p class="">The next event is the birth of 
                            the Princess Royal,
                         on November 21, 1840. Childbearing become a habit with
                        this couple; the Prince would always attend to his wife, moving her from bed to
                        sofa during her confinements. "As years went on, and he became overwhelmed
                        with work... , this was often done at much inconvenience to himself; but
                        he ever came with a sweet smile on his face. In short, his care of her was
                        like that of a mother, nor could there have been a kinder, wiser, or more
                        judicious nurse" (45). </p>
<p class="">Knowing that the royal family is prolific and that Victoria and Albert are
                        happy until his unexpected death, the reader anticipates a kind of lulling
                        effect in this biography, perhaps to be enjoyed like a real-life fairy tale.
                        The 
                            Prince of Wales
                         was born November 9, 1841, and christened the following
                        January. "The Queen writes in her Journal:
                        'To think we have two children now, and one who enjoys the sight already
                        (the Christmas-tree); it is like a dream.' And again, in a pretty, maternal
                        way, 'Albert brought in dearest little Pussy (Princess Victoria) in such a
                        smart white merino dress, trimmed with blue' and sitting together as a
                        family of four gave her a feeling of happiness (45-46). Carey presupposes
                        Victoria's maternal devotion&mdash;"What true womanly words!"&mdash;but
                        recent biographers have recalled that Victoria's journals and letters
                        indicate her general dislike of motherhood. </p>
<p class="">A modern reader might wonder about Carey's silence on subjects that usually
                        consitute "history." This is characteristic of contemporary short
                        biographies of the Queen, which credit her with the spirit of her age but
                        reduce that age to a few outline events. Rather abruptly, Victoria's
                        domestic idyll gains a background of the "troubles" of 1842.
                        "There was terrible news from Afghanistan, and though the British arms ultimately
                        conquered, there were fearfully heavy losses.... There was also war with China, and the condition of things at
                        home was most unsatisfactory, and a growing agitation on account of the corn
                            laws.
                        There were fears of a Chartist rising, and to offer a stimulus to trade the
                        Queen gave a <em>bal masque</em> at Buckingham Palace, ...'The Queen's Plantagenet Ball.'"
                        The impertinence of a festival of consumption (and anachronism) to address
                        an economic crisis persists in the life of Queen Victoria, with Carey's
                        stamp of approval. </p>
<p class=""> Also in 1842, Victoria survived two assassination attempts,
                        showing "the utmost courage," and leniency toward her attackers (47). The
                        Queen's "first railway journey" (47) initiates a series of journeys,
                        particularly the holidays to Scotland, punctuating the catalogue of children
                        born and relatives died. Once the text has identified the complete series of
                        royal children, Carey devotes some paragraphs to the theme of child-rearing
                        and education, largely through extended quotation of other biographies. Thus
                            "that
                            charming book, 'The Private Life of the Queen,' by one of Her Majesty's
                            servants, tells us that the Queen 'always made time in her busy life to
                            bathe with her own hands the last new baby'" (49).
                        Predictably, Victoria repeats the
                            principles of her own upbringing, "simplicity," "discipline,"
                            sequestration from "Court life," along with the employment of first-rate
                            instructors in languages and arts, and conscientious religious training
                            (49).
                    </p>
<p class="">Carey's seems surprisingly preoccupied by biographies of Prince Albert, as if
                        sharing the Queen's infatuation. He was the Queen's "truest advisor and
                        counsellor," and she came to "lean more on that strong arm and bright
                        intellect" (50). It was Albert who oversaw the design and growth of the
                        island home, Osborne. And of course it was Albert who devised the Great Exhibition, a
                        source of joyful pride to Victoria: "'The
                        only event it in the slightest degree reminded me of was the coronation, but
                        this day's festival was a thousand times superior." Victoria's writing calls
                        the opening of the Exhibition "The proudest and happiest day of... my happy
                        life. . . . To see this great conception of my beloved husband's
                        mind...crowned with triumphant success" (52-53).</p>
<p class="">The awkward intermingling of family and historical events continues. In
                            1854, Victoria declared war with Russia. "The Queen suffered so
                        keenly for her soldiers, that one of the Royal children said to Lord
                        Cardigan, when he came to Windsor, 'You must hurry back to Sebastopol and take it, else
                            it will kill mamma'" (54). The following paragraphs adjoin news of
                        the birth of the last child, engagement of the first, and "the awful tidings
                        of the Indian
                        Mutiny....And again the Queen's womanly sympathies were strongly
                        excited by the terrible details of Cawnpore. On the Princess Royal's wedding
                        day the Queen wrote in her Journal: 'The second most eventful day of my life
                        as regards feelings. I felt as though I was being married over again myself,
                        only much more nervous'" (54). Perhaps biography must commit such solecisms
                        of scale and perspective. The subject's life necessarily comes to the fore;
                        the births of children or the emotions when these children are wed
                        inevitably claim importance, even if the subject should also care about war
                        and genocide. It is neither the Queen's nor Carey's job to tell the complete
                        public story.</p>
<p class="">Carey's narrative raises more than one glaring mystery in spite of its polite
                        veneer. Why did Prince Albert fail? Carey shifts among explanations: he was
                        strained by "his responsibility as private adviser to Her Majesty" and the
                        "'pressure which constantly compelled him to do in one day what would have
                        been more than ample work for two'" (unidentified source; 55-56); the
                        doctors' diagnosed typhoid fever, contracted in a visit to a military
                        academy in torrential rain; and yet, "Not long before his fatal illness, in
                        speaking to the Queen, he said: 'I do not cling to life; you do, but I set
                        no store by it'" (56). Could he have wished to fade out of a wife-like role
                        as helpmeet to an imperial sovereign? Carey synthesizes the many famous
                        accounts of Prince Albert's illness by Victoria, Princess Alice, and other
                        witnesses. The chapter concludes with a verse by "our glorious Poet
                        Laureate" and these words: "'Their works do follow them.' Truly we may say
                        of our Great Prince that his beloved name is graven indelibly on the hearts
                        and memories of  all English men and English women" (59). </p>
<p class="">The final chapter, "Widowhood," "A Royal Mourner," with yet another
                        occasional verse by Tennyson, begins with an exceptional self-reference by
                        the narrator. "The writer of this sketch well remembers that melancholy
                        Sunday, December 15th, when the omission of the Prince Consort's name from
                        the Litany informed the congregation that their revered monarch was a widow.
                        A thrill ran through the church" (62). The congregation's mingled prayers
                        give way to the narrative of the queen's illness and grief, and the scene of
                        the funeral. The loss was collective: "Throughout the country there was long
                        and genuine mourning....'There is no one to call me Victoria now,' the
                        Queen is said to have exclaimed, the morning of her bereavement,&mdash;and perhaps
                        no words could have expressed more strongly the sense of her great
                        loneliness" (63).</p>
<p class=""> Carey quotes letters and poems about the episode and Victoria's continuing
                        period of mourning.  "'For some years after the death of the
                            Prince Consort,' as Dr. Macaulay tells us, 'the Queen appeared very
                            little in public'" although "'no official duty as neglected.'
                        Neither did she forget the troubles of others; for when that terrible
                        Hartley colliery disaster occurred, by which 204 miners lost their lives,
                        Her Majesty sent a message to the effect 'that her tenderest sympathy is
                        with the poor widows and mothers, and that her own misery only makes her
                        feel the more for them'" (65). In response to complaints, Victoria had a
                        letter sent to the <em>Times</em> to the effect that "there
                        are other and higher duties than those of mere representation which are now
                        thrown on the Queen alone and unassisted.'" The people will not demand that
                        she wear herself out appearing at every ceremony. </p>
<p class="">And yet much of the remaining narrative is a series of ceremonies, some
                        family weddings, some visits to hospitals, and some consecrations of statues
                        or memorials to Albert. Meanwhile, the "Queen showed her deep solicitude for
                        her subjects by causing a letter to be written to the various directors of
                        the railway companies, calling their attention to the increasing number of
                        serious accidents" (68), and instituted the Albert Medal for those who
                        saved, or endeavoured to save, the lives of others from shipwreck or other
                        perils of the sea" (69). She opened waterworks in Aberdeen and "laid the
                        first stone" of what became the Royal Albert Hall and for St. Thomas's
                        Hospital, among other sites (69-70).</p>
<p class="">The log of ceremonial appearances and events accumulates, sometimes in
                        paragraphs of a single sentence. Children and grandchildren are married,
                        fall ill, recover, or die; buidings are opened or memorials dedicated. Then,
                        Carey shifts tactics, condensing good deeds and years in one paragraph,
                        quoted in part here: "There were numerous other good works inaugurated by
                        the Queen during the next few years: the laying of the foundation stone of
                        the new Medical Examination Hall of the Royal College of Physicians and
                        Surgeons...[etc.]. There have been three royal jubilees in the history of
                        England, but none of them can compare with the Jubilee of June 21st, 1887,
                        unless it be the Jubilee of 1897, when our beloved Sovereign commemorated
                        the sixtieth year of her reign. It was a sight that thrilled all hearts when
                        the Queen left her palace gates that June morning, surrounded by her
                        glorious guard of honour, sons, sons-in-law and grandsons, on her way to
                        Westminster Abbey. The fair young Queen of fifty years before was now a
                        grey-haired woman, but the loving heart still responded to her faithful
                        subjects' acclamations" (74). </p>
<p class="">Here Carey returns to her method of splicing biographical sources. "There can
                        be little doubt, as Barnett Smith tells us, that  'Her Majesty has
                            outlived all her early friends and faithful servants. All who officiated
                            at her coronation have passed into the land of shadows. If she has
                            tasted all the happiness of life, she has tasted likewise its
                            bitterness, for death has ever been busy laying his finger here and
                            there. . . . The Queen's reign is coincident with the most surprising
                            progress at home and abroad. It has been the age of railways, of
                            trans-oceanic steamers and of the telegraph, of free trade,
                            parliamentary reform, and the abolition of the corn laws'" (75).
                        Her "firm serene rule, keen intellect, and wide sympathies" have guided an
                        age of enlightened progress and imperial expansion. </p>
<p class="">Carey repeatedly emphasizes the image of Victoria as elderly and frail. For
                        the sake of fresh air, she sets up an outdoor office. The book "The Private
                        Life of the Queen" is quoted as before: "'At Windsor the little Frogmore tea-house,
                            with its lovely surroundings, is the chosen spot; and here, beneath the
                            shade of two magnificent evergreen oaks, the Queen's writing-table and
                            despatch-boxes are set out on fine mornings, while two mounted
                            messengers keep up perpetual communication with the telegraph office and
                            telephones at the Castle; and the attendant secretary stands at her
                            side. ... In addition to the public work, the self-imposed private work
                            done by Her Majesty is extraordinary'" (76). Unsurpassable as
                        correspondent, the Queen makes her presence felt in letters of sympathy to
                        the survivors of any disaster. Further, she studies Hindustani and "the
                        Empress of India writes her diary in that language. It has been said, 'that
                        if the Queen had been destined to write in lieu of ruling, she must have
                        left a great mark on the literature of the country'" (76). Carey, perhaps
                        less certain of the power of writing unless supported by many excerpts from
                        others' texts, concludes characteristically with a poem that is also a
                        prayer. Unlike most biographies, this one defers the expected ending, which
                        will grant a whole nation a sense of closure in the emotionally mixed
                        performance of a state funeral.</p>
