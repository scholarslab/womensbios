                        downtrodden. Yet Fanny ultimately
                        saved her own family through her caricature of American life and her production of pleasing
                        fiction.</p>
<p class="">Even before her expedition to America,
                            Fanny had experienced a fair
                        share of hardships. Five years after her birth on March 10,
                            1779, in Stapleton, Bristol, Fanny suffered the loss of her dear mother Mary
                            Milton. Her mother&rsquo;s death and the subsequent remarriage of her
                        father, William Milton, the vicar of Heckfield, to Sarah Partington of Clifton in 1800 instilled a great deal of self-reliance
                        in the young Fanny. However close
                            Fanny's relationship with
                            Mary was during those five years, the majority of family
                        friends remembered Fanny as bearing
                        the closest resemblance of her two siblings to her father
                            (Neville-Sington, <em>Oxford
                        Dictionary</em>). A vicar by trade, William possessed a keen
                        predilection for science, mathematics, and inventing, and he &ldquo;preferred
                        inventing gadgets to saving souls&rdquo; (Neville-Sington, <em>Oxford Dictionary</em>). Both Fanny and her father shared an
                        incapacity for idleness, an inclination for math and mending, and a certain
                        rashness. While other girls were busy sewing, Fanny was indulging in the works of
                            Shakespeare, Milton, and Petrarch
                            (Neville-Sington, <em>Fanny Trollope</em>,
                        7). These
                        cerebral qualities, along with her bright and pleasant persona, made her a
                        delight in society, among friends, and to her beloved mother.</p>
<p class="">Fanny&rsquo;s family with
                            Thomas provided a source of great joy and despair in her
                        life. Five years after moving to London
                        with her brother and sister in 1803, Fanny met
                        barrister Thomas Trollope, and in 1809, they married. Living at first on Keppel Street, the same street where she had shared a
                        house with her siblings a few years prior, the Trollopes
                        immediately began their family, first with Fanny&rsquo;s beloved son Thomas
                            Adolphus (Tom) in 1810. Over the next eight years Fanny gave birth to six other
                        children: Henry, Arthur, Emily (who
                        lived one day), Anthony, Cecilia, and
                            Emily. Cecilia and Emily (the
                        youngest) were born after the family&rsquo;s move to Harrow-on-the-Hill, the leased farm at which
                            Mr. Trollope built a house. The family moved there in
                            1817
                            (Trollope, 42). Unfortunately, farming did not agree with
                            Mr. Trollope; Thomas's complete lack of
                        agricultural expertise, along with the unexpected denial of his uncle&rsquo;s
                        inheritance and the strain of sending five sons to Winchester for schooling, slowing crippled the family&rsquo;s
                        finances (Neville-Sington, <em>Oxford
                            Dictionary</em>).</p>
<p class="">Fanny maintained her Victorian
                        stoicism in her lack of outward reaction to their dire circumstances. In her
                        vast collection of correspondence, she makes only one reference to
                            Thomas's temper and virtually no mention of the
                            Trollopes' financial problems. Fanny only revealed her feelings and
                        family life in her later novels, in which she devised stories of strained
                        husband-wife and husband-son relationships with the knowledge of someone who
                        had personally experienced such tension and sorrow. Her novel <em>One Fault</em> traces the breakdown of a marriage, while
                        spousal verbal abuse is prevalent in <em>Romance of
                            Vienna</em>. In <em>Fashionable Life</em>, Fanny writes, &ldquo;We are often told that
                        the first falling in love is an important epoch in existence&hellip; Perhaps the
                        first time of falling into anger, may also be an important epoch, and
                        produce a great change.&rdquo; Through a rather cathartic writing style, Fanny drew strength from her anger
                            (Neville-Sington, <em>Fanny Trollope</em>,
                        111). Fanny also proved she could
                        think independently from her husband, and relied upon her female friends as
                        her husband became more of a distant stranger. The friendships Fanny developed at Harrow proved invaluable, and through these
                        acquaintances and relationships Fanny was introduced to Fanny Wright.</p>
<p class="">Fanny Wright may rightly be considered responsible for Fanny Trollope&rsquo;s
                        American journey. Wright,
                        the ward of French hero General
                            Lafayette, became an intimate friend of the
                            Trollopes, and secured an invitation in 1824 for the family to
                        visit La Grange, Lafayette&rsquo;s
                        estate in France. The subsequent visits
                        of the family to France over the next
                        three years ultimately sparked in Fanny the idea of an American excursion. Wright and her sister had plans
                        to travel to their property in Tennessee
                        to begin to reform the education of Afican American children. When
                            Henry dropped out of Winchester in 1826, the Trollopes struggled to discover an
                        occupation for the young man; the family&rsquo;s financial state would not allow
                        for an indolent son and neither would Mr. Trollope. With the
                        help of General Lafayette the Trollopes secured a
                        position for Henry in a Parisian office. However, the city proved too much for
                            Henry alone, and a new solution was required (<em>Trollope</em>, 77-85).</p>
<p class="">Fanny came to view America
                        as an opportunity to mend multiple issues: in America she could cheaply educate Henry (as well as
                        her two young daughters) at the Wrights&rsquo; school while also
                        solving the family&rsquo;s monetary woes. Fanny believed America to be
                        an easy money-making venture, and she and Mr. Trollope devised
                        plans to establish a bazaar or emporium for imported fancy goods in Cincinnati (<em>Trollope</em>, 99). Wright wrote and encouraged Fanny to bring Henry to
                            America; Henry also
                        added pressure by constantly telling Fanny that his future was in America (Neville-Sington, <em>Fanny
                            Trollope</em>, 109). Fanny&rsquo;s
                        devotion to Henry was very closely linked to the loss of her
                        son Arthur, who died of consumption at age twelve
                            (Neville-Sington, <em>Fanny Trollope</em>,
                        105). Fanny poured much of herself
                        into bettering Henry and providing the clearest and safest path
                        to a secure future. Self-reliant and courageous as always, Fanny, along with Henry,
                            Cecilia, Emily, and close family friend
                            Auguste Hervieu, set out in November of 1827 for America; Mr. Trollope and
                            Tom were to follow before long. Father and son ultimately
                        did come for a time to America, but in
                            1831, the
                        entire family returned to England,
                        further in debt and with little hope.</p>
<p class="">America drastically changed Fanny Trollope. Some have read a
                        marital rift in the period of separation between husband and wife and the
                        intimacy between Fanny Trollope and Auguste Hervieu, collaborator in the
                        speculative scheme of the bazaar. Monetarily, the family emerged in worse
                        debt, mostly due to the failed bazaar. Fanny herself came to America a liberal and determined woman, but her disappointing
                        experience with Fanny Wright's utopian scheme and the dreary cultural
                        climate Trollope perceived in Cincinnati and elsewhere transformed her
                        views; she returned to England fiercely
                        opposed to democracy and to its resulting &ldquo;universal degradation&rdquo;
                            (Pope-Hennessy, 107). Such vehemence is readily apparent in
                            <em>Domestic Manners</em>. While her political views
                        changed, Trollope&rsquo;s optimism and
                        industriousness did not diminish, and she published the memoir of her
                        travels in 1833.</p>
<p class="">"No English persons of that day were ever
                        prepared to admit that they were not generally attractive and superior to
                        every foreigner they met,&rdquo; and Frances
                            Trollope&rsquo;s criticism of America perpetuated this strong sense of English pride
                            (Pope-Hennessy, 16). Her reputation and persona, created in
                            <em>Domestic Manners</em>, superseded her, and many who
                        met her were surprised to find her a &ldquo;most elegant and agreeable woman&rdquo;
                            (Neville-Sington, <em>Fanny Trollope</em>,
                        342). If taken alone, <em>Domestic Manners</em> presents a
                        somewhat different understanding of her journey than the reality. Trollope excludes all details that do
                        not reflect solely on the Americans; she
                        offers no mention of the bazaar, Hervieu, finances, or Nashoba,
                        the Wrights&rsquo;
                        Tennessee venture, and rarely speaks of
                        her children.</p>
<p class="">Her book presents a woman who left her husband, uprooted her children, and
                        traveled to America, where she flitted
                        about making judgments of its people before returning back to England a few years after. The truth is
                        altogether different. Throughout Trollope's sojourn in America, Hervieu assisted her in her personal mission
                        to save her family not only from their financial troubles but more
                        importantly from themselves. Regardless of what some saw as her questionable
                        morality, her book became an instant success and even spawned the verb &ldquo;to
                        trollopise,&rdquo; meaning to sermonize on experiences
                        (Pope-Hennessy, 16). Many Americans and Europeans
                        alike attacked Mrs. Trollope,
                        professing: &ldquo;Although Mrs. Trollope
                        maintained that the standard of moral character in the United States was greatly lower than that of Europe, she herself was considered
                        something of a profligate woman&rdquo; (Farewell). Her book received both praise
                        and abuse, but above all it saved her family and made her famous.</p>
<p class="">From the age of fifty until her death thirty years later, Trollope published thirty-five novels
                        and six travel books, enabling her to support her family through her writing
                            (Neville-Sington, <em>Oxford
                        Dictionary</em>). Travel writing had proved a popular and profitable form;
                        Captain Basil Hall&rsquo;s
                        <em>Travels In North America</em> had created a feeling of
                        ill-feeling towards America, fostering a
                        hungry market anticipating the next anti-American literature (Farewell). Unfortunately, debt quickly
                        swallowed the vast majority of Trollope&rsquo;s earnings. In the decade following the publication of
                            <em>Domestic Manners</em>, the Trollopes
                        moved from place to place in an effort to escape the debt that continued to
                        plague the family. Although under the threat of debtor&rsquo;s prison, Trollope maintained her amicability
                        and pursued her love of hosting parties and having polite but intellectually
                        stimulating conversations. Her guest list grew to include Joseph Henry
                            Green (Samuel Taylor Coleridge&rsquo;s literary executor),
                        as well as Reverend R.W. Thackeray (William
                            Thackeray&rsquo;s relative) and his family
                            (Neville-Sington, <em>Fanny Trollope</em>,
                        253). Trollope often worked on
                        multiple books at once, and continued to write through the deaths of her son
                            Henry, her husband, and her daughter Emily
                        between 1834 and
                            1836. Even in
                        the midst of such heartbreak, her literary works &ldquo;never bore the shadow of
                        her circumstances. They were as bright at the first as when, later,
                        circumstances brightened&rdquo; (<em>Glasgow Herald</em>).</p>
<p class="">Self-disciplined as always, she managed to maintain her writing schedule. As
                        she continued to travel, she wrote of her experiences on the European continent and of the affluent
                        people she met. Her son the successful novelist Anthony
                        commented in <em>An Autobiography</em> that &ldquo;she was at her
                        table at four in the morning, and had finished her work before the world had
                        begun to be aroused.&rdquo; She lived close to her daughter Cecilia
                        until Cecilia married in 1841, and in 1843
                        Trollope fulfilled her dream of
                        visiting Italy and moved to Florence permanently. In Florence she continued her role of hosting dinner
                        parties and attracted such literary elites as Elizabeth Barrett
                        and Robert Browning. In 1844, Charles Dickens arrived
                        for his first tour of Italy.
                            Tom became friends with the thirty-three-year-old
                            Dickens, to whom Fanny also appeared partial. Trollope was fond of including allusions to
                            Dickens&rsquo;s works within her own novels, showing admiration
                        and respect for her fellow author (Neville-Sington, <em>Fanny Trollope</em>, 315). During this time, in
                            1849, she lost
                            Cecilia to tuberculosis, the same cause of death as for her
                        other family members. Remaining in Florence, Fanny shared the Villino Trollope with her
                        son Anthony and his wife from 1850 on. Her health steadily deteriorated
                        and she died peacefully in bed on October 6, 1863
                            (Neville-Sington, <em>Oxford
                            Dictionary.</em>
