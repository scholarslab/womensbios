<p class="" id="N14983_p">Jane was the
                        eldest daughter of Henry Grey, third Marquis of Dorset, and of Frances,
                        daughter of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. Her date of birth is not known
                        precisely, but it is now believed to be sometime in the year 1536, at her
                        father's stately mansion of Bradgate, 
                        near Leicester. Her father provided her with two learned tutors in his two
                        chaplains, Thomas Harding and John Aylmer. The majority of her charge being
                        given to Aylmer, Lady Jane soon gained a thorough acquaintance with Latin
                        and Greek, and also some degree of proficiency in Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldaic,
                        French and Italian. These tutors also served as her religious instructors,
                        and Jane became a devout Protestant. In addition to her incredible
                        linguistic achievements, she possessed wonderful musical and vocal talents;
                        excelled in needlework and embroidery; was skilled in the culinary arts; and
                        was gifted in calligraphy. At an early age, then, she stood out amongst her
                        peers.</p>

<p class="">In 1546, After King Henry VIII&rsquo;s
                        death, Jane was sent to live as a ward of the widowed Queen Catherine Parr; and when she married Lord Thomas Seymour  of Dudley,
                        Jane accompanied them to Hanworth in Middlesex, the palace which Henry VIII
                        had bestowed upon Catherine as dowry. The Queen died not long afterwards, in
                        1548; and at her funeral it was Lady Jane who acted as chief mourner. Soon
                        afterwards, back with her parents at Bradgate, she composed the following
                        letter of gratitude and affection to Lord Seymour:</p>
<p class="block">
                        
<em>October 1, 1548.</em>
                    
</p>
<p class="block">
                        
<em>
                             My duty to your
                                lordship, in most humble wise remembered, with no less thanks for
                                the gentle letters which I received from you. Thinking myself so
                                much bound to your lordship for your great goodness towards me from
                                time to time, that I cannot by any means be able to recompense the
                                least part thereof, I purposed to write a few rude lines unto your
                                lordship, rather as a token to show how much worthier I think your
                                lordship's goodness than to give worthy thanks for the same; and
                                these my letters shall be to testify unto you that, like as you have
                                become towards me a loving and kind father, so I shall be always
                                most ready to obey your godly monitions and good instructions, as
                                becometh one upon whom you have heaped so many benefits. And thus,
                                fearing lest I should trouble your lordship too much, I must humbly
                                take my leave of your good lordship.

<em>Jane Grey.</em>
                    
</p>
<p class="">Jane&rsquo;s time spent at Dudley
                            Castle with the Queen Consort and her husband Lord Thomas Seymour
                            comprised, it seems, some of the happiest moments of her life.
                        Mabie and Stephens write:</p>
<p class="block">Her parents acted upon the maxim that to spare the rod is to
                        spoil the child; and notwithstanding her amiability and honourable
                        diligence, subjected her to a very severe discipline. She was rigorously
                        punished for the slightest defect in her behaviour or the most trivial
                        failure in her studies. Her parents taught her to fear, rather than to love,
                        them; and insisted upon reverence, rather than affection, as the duty of
                        children. It is no wonder, therefore, that from the austere brow and
                        unsympathetic voice she turned with ever-increasing delight towards that
                        secret spirit of knowledge which has only smiles for its votaries.</p>
<p class="block">In the pages of the wise she met with divine words of
                        encouragement and consolation; they soothed her sorrows, they taught her the
                        heroism of endurance, they lifted her into that serene realm where dwelt the
                        Immortals&mdash;the glorious minds of old. "Thus," says she, "my book hath been so much my
                            pleasure, and bringeth daily to me more and more pleasure, that in
                            respect of it all other pleasures in very deed be but trifles and
                            troubles unto me."</p>
<p class="">
                        A passage from Roger Ascham&rsquo;s &ldquo;Schoolmaster,&rdquo;
                            describing his visit to Bradgate in the summer of 1550, gives us a
                            colorful rendition of Lady Jane Grey at about 14 years of age. Upon
                            arriving at the house, he had found everyone out hunting &mdash;except for the
                            young Jane, who was &ldquo;calmly studying the pages of Plato&rsquo;s immortal
                            &lsquo;Phaedon&rsquo; in the original Greek.&rdquo; Surprised, he asks why she had not
                            gone along with the others:
                    </p>
<p class="block">
                         "I wis," she replied,
                            smiling, "all their sport in the park is but a shadow to that pleasure
                            that I find in Plato. Alas! good folk, they never felt what true
                            pleasure meant."
                    </p>
<p class="block">
                        "And how came you,
                            madam," quoth he, "to this deep knowledge of pleasure? And what did
                            chiefly allure you unto it, seeing not many women, but very few men,
                            have attained thereunto?"
                    </p>
<p class="block">
                        "I will tell you,"
                            quoth she, "and tell you a truth which, perchance, ye will marvel at.
                            One of the greatest benefits that ever God gave me is that He sent me so
                            sharp and severe parents and so gentle a schoolmaster. For when I am in
                            presence either of father or mother, whether I speak, keep silence, sit,
                            stand, or go, eat, drink, be merry or sad, be sewing, playing, dancing
                            or doing anything else, I must do it, as it were, in such weight,
                            measure and number, even so perfectly as God made the world, or else I
                            am so sharply taunted, so cruelly threatened, yea, presently, sometimes
                            with pinches, nips and bobs, and other ways which I will not name for
                            the honour I bear them, so without reason misordered, that I think
                            myself in hell till time come that I must go to Mr. Aylmer; who teacheth
                            me so gently, so pleasantly, with such fair allurements to learning,
                            that I think all the time nothing whiles I am with him. And when I am
                            called from him, I fall on weeping, because, whatever I do else but
                            learning is full of grief, trouble, fear and whole misliking unto
                            me."
                    </p>
<p class="block">Ascham did not see her again after this memorable interview. "I
                        remember this talk gladly," he wrote, "both because it is so worthy of
                        memory and because also it was the last talk that ever I had and the last
                        time that ever I saw that noble and worthy lady."</p>
<p class="block">
                        In his letters to his learned
                            friends, however, he frequently commented on the sweetness of her
                            character and the depth of her erudition. He spoke of Lady Mildred Cooke
                            and the Lady Jane Grey as the two most learned women in England; and
                            summed up his praises of the latter in the remark that "however
                            illustrious she was by her fortune and royal extraction, this bore no
                            proportion to the accomplishments of her mind, adorned with the doctrine
                            of Plato and the eloquence of Demosthenes."
                    </p>
<p class="">Her high rank, strong piety, and precociousness caused Lady Jane to have
                        great attention paid to her by leaders of the Reformed Church in England and
                        abroad. Among the principal Reformers to have contact with and influence on
                        her were Martin Bruce, whom Edward
                        VI had made chair of the divinity at Cambridge, and Heinrich Bullinger, a Swiss reformer and head of the
                        Zurich church.</p>
<p class="">In October of 1551, Jane&rsquo;s father, then Marquis of Dorset, was given the
                        title of Duke of Suffolk. Lady Jane accompanied her family to Suffolk Place,
                        where, as Mabie and Stephens record, &ldquo;she necessarily shared in the
                        festivities of the court; but she would seem to have been distinguished
                        always by a remarkable plainness of apparel.&rdquo; The biographers give us a
                        further illustration of Jane&rsquo;s austerity:</p>
<p class="block">
                        On one occasion the Princess
                            Mary presented her with a sumptuous robe, which she was desired to wear
                            in recognition of the donor's generosity. "Nay," she replied, "that were
                            a shame, to follow my Lady Mary, who leaveth God's word, and leave my
                            Lady Elizabeth who followeth God's word." A speech which the Lady Mary
                            doubtless remembered.
                    </p>
<p class="">In 1553, as the fifteen-year old Edward VI lay dying, a series of events were
                        engineered to install Lady Jane Grey as heiress to the throne. At the time,
                        Edward&rsquo;s legitimate successor was his older sister Mary, but her devotion to
                        the Catholic Church caused the Reformers in and around the court much
                        anxiety. 
                                John Dudley, the Duke of Northumberland, had aspirations for
                            raising his son to the throne, and arranged a marriage between Jane and
                            his son Guilford Dudley. The
                            wedding took place in June at Northumberland&rsquo;s palace in the Strand, and
                            the Duke then persuaded Edward to exclude his two sisters Mary and
                            Elizabeth from the throne via letters patent&mdash;and thus Jane became next
                            in line for the crown.</p>
<p class="">A few days afterwards the young Edward died, and on the 9th of July she was asked
                        to assume the throne. Her acceptance is recorded in her own words:</p>
<p class="block">
                        
                            "How I was beside
                                myself, stupefied and troubled, I will leave it to those lords who
                                were present to testify, who saw me overcome by sudden and
                                unexpected grief, fall on the ground, weeping very bitterly; and
                                then declaring to them my insufficiency, I greatly bewailed myself
                                for the death of so noble a Prince, and at the same time turned
                                myself to God, humbly praying and beseeching Him that if what was
                                given to me was rightly and lawfully mine, His divine Majesty would
                                grant me such grace and spirit that I might govern it to His glory
                                and service and to the advantage of this realm."
                        
                    </p>
<p class="">But the reign of Queen Jane Grey would be short-lived. On the 19th of July,
                        Edward&rsquo;s sister Mary, who had
                        previously been heiress to the throne, rode into London with a large number
                        of supporters. 
                        Her claim to the throne was
                            revoked, and, having been tried and found guilty of high treason, Mary
                            imprisoned both her and her husband in the Tower of London.</p>
<p class="">
                        While
                            being held captive in the Tower, she engraved on the walls of her
                            prison--with a pin--the following text in Latin, translated by Mabie and
                            Stephens:
                    </p>
<span class="verse-group "><span class="verse-line">

                        </span></span>
<p class="">The date of February 12th was set for her execution. The night before, she
                        wrote the following letter to her father--"in which filial reverence softens
                        and subdues the exhortations of a dying saint":</p>
<p class="block">

<em>Jane Dudley.</em>
                    
</p>
<p class="">Mabie and Stephens give an endearing account of Lady Jane Grey&rsquo;s final hours&mdash;
                        an anecdote worth reprinting and with which we end.</p>
<p class="block">
                        Mary and her advisers had originally intended that both Lady Jane and her
                        husband should be executed together on Tower Hill; but reflection convinced
                        them that the spectacle of so comely and youthful a pair suffering for what
                        was rather the crime of others than their own, might powerfully awaken the
                        sympathies of the multitude, and produce a revulsion of feeling. It was
                        ordered, therefore, that Lady Jane should suffer within the precincts of the
                        Tower.</p>
<p class="block">The fatal morning came. The young husband&mdash;still a bridegroom and
                        a lover&mdash;had obtained permission to bid her a last farewell; but she refused
                        to see him, apprehensive that so bitter a parting might overwhelm them, and
                        deprive them of the courage needful to face death with calmness. She sent
                        him, however, many loving messages, reminding him how brief would be their
                        separation, and how quickly they would meet in a brighter and better
                        world.</p>
<p class="block">In going to his death on Tower Hill, he passed beneath the
                        window of her cell; so that they had an opportunity of exchanging a farewell
                        look. He behaved on the scaffold with calm intrepidity. After spending a
                        brief space in silent devotion, he requested the prayers of the spectators,
                        and, laying his head upon the block, gave the fatal signal. At one blow his
                        head was severed from his body.</p>
<p class="block">The scaffold on which the girl-queen was to close her stainless
                        career had been erected on the green opposite the White Tower. As soon as
                        her husband was dead the officers announced that the sheriffs waited to
                        attend her thither. And when she had gone down and been delivered into their
                        hands, the bystanders noted in her "a countenance so gravely settled and
                        with all modest and comely resolution, that not the least symptom either of
                        fear or grief could be perceived either in her speech or motions; she was
                        like one going to be united to her heart's best and longest beloved."</p>
<p class="block"> So, like a
                            martyr, crowned with glory, she went unto her death. Her serene
                        composure was scarcely shaken when, through an unfortunate misunderstanding
                        of the officer in command, she met on her way her husband's headless trunk
                        being borne to its last resting-place.</p>
<p class="block">"Oh Guilford! Guilford!" she exclaimed; "the ante-past is not so
                        bitter that you have tasted, and that I shall soon taste, as to make my
                        flesh tremble; it is nothing compared to the feast that you and I shall this
                        day partake of in heaven." This thought renewed her strength and sustained and consoled, we might
                            almost believe, by ministering angels, she proceeded to the scaffold
                            with as much grace and dignity as if it were a wedding banquet that
                            awaited her.</p>
<p class="block">She was conducted by Sir John Brydges, the Lieutenant of the
                        Tower, and attended by her two waiting-women, Mrs. Elizabeth Tylney and Mrs.
                        Ellen. While these wept and sobbed bitterly, her eyes were dry, and her countenance shone
                            with the light of a sure and certain hope. She read earnestly her
                        manual of prayers. On reaching the place of execution she saluted the lords
                        and gentlemen present with unshaken composure and infinite grace. No
                        minister of her own Church had been allowed to attend her, and she did not
                        care to accept the services of Feckenham, Queen Mary's confessor. She was
                        not indifferent, however, to his respectful sympathy and when bidding him
                        farewell, she said:</p>
<p class="block">"Go now; God grant you all your desires, and accept my own warm
                        thanks for your attentions to me; although, indeed, those attentions have
                        tried me more than death could now terrify me."</p>
<p class="block">To the spectators she addressed a few gentle words, in admirable
                        keeping with the gentle tenor of her life.</p>
<p class="block">
                        "Good people," she
                            exclaimed, "I am come hither to die, and by law I am condemned to the
                            same. My offence to the Queen's Highness was only in consent to the
                            device of others, which now is deemed treason; but it was never my
                            seeking, but by counsel of those who should seem to have further
                            understanding of things than I, who knew little of the law, and much
                            less of the titles to the Crown. I pray you all, good Christian people,
                            to bear me witness that I die a true Christian woman, and that I look to
                            be saved by none other means but only by the mercy of God, in the merits
                            of the blood of His only son, Jesus Christ; and I confess, when I did
                            know the word of God, I neglected the same, loved myself and the world,
                            and therefore this plague or punishment is happily and worthily happened
                            unto me for my sins; and yet I thank God of His goodness, that He hath
                            thus given me a time and respite to repent. And now, good people, while
                            I am alive, I pray you to assist me with your prayers."
                    </p>
<p class="block">She knelt to her devotions, and turning to Feckenham, inquired
                        whether she should repeat the Miserere psalm (the fifty-first, "Have mercy
                        upon me, O Lord").</p>
<p class="block">He replied in the affirmative; and she said it with great
                        earnestness from beginning to end. Rising from her knees, she began to
                        prepare herself for the headsman and pulling off her gloves, gave them and
                        her handkerchief to Mistress Tylney. The manual of prayers, in which she had
                        written at the desire of the Lieutenant, she handed to Thomas Brydges, his
                        brother. When she was unfastening her robe, the executioner would have
                        assisted her, but she motioned him aside, and accepted the last offices of
                        her waiting-women, who then gave her a white handkerchief with which to
                        bandage her eyes.</p>
<p class="block">Throwing himself at her feet, the headsman humbly craved her
                        forgiveness, which she willingly granted. He then requested her to stand
                        upon the straw, and in complying with his direction she for the first time
                        saw the fatal block. Her composure remained unshaken; she simply entreated
                        the executioner to dispatch her quickly. Again kneeling she asked him:</p>
<p class="block">"Will you take it off before I lay me down?"</p>
<p class="block">"No, madam," he replied.</p>
<p class="block">She bound the handkerchief round her eyes, and feeling for the
                        block, exclaimed,</p>
<p class="block">"What shall I do? Where is it?"</p>
<p class="block">Being guided to it by one of the bystanders, she laid her head
                        down, exclaiming, in an audible voice:</p>
<p class="block">"Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit."</p>
<p class="block">In an instant the axe fell, and the tragedy was consummated. An
                        involuntary groan from the assembled multitude seemed to acknowledge that
                        vengeance had been satisfied, but justice outraged.</p>
<p class="block">
                        Lady Jane&mdash;or Queen Jane, as
                            she should more properly be called &mdash;was little more than seventeen years
                            old when she thus fell a victim to Mary's jealous fears and hate. She
                            had hardly entered upon womanhood, and the promise of her young life had
                            had no time to ripen into fruition. We may well believe, however, that
                            she would not have disappointed the hopes which that promise had
                            awakened.
                         Her heroic death showed how
                            well she had profited by the lessons she had imbibed in her early
                            years.
                    </p>
<p class="block">There was no affectation, no exaggeration, in her conduct upon
                        the scaffold; but she bore herself with serene dignity and with true
                        courage. It was worthy of her life&mdash;which, brief as an unhappy fortune made it, was full of
                        beauty, full of calmness, and truth, and elevation and modest piety.  The impression which
                            it made upon her contemporaries, an impression taken up and retained by
                            posterity, is visible in the fact to this hour we speak of her as she
                            was in her sweet simple maidenhood&mdash;we pass over her married name and her
                            regal title, and love to honour her, not as Lady Jane Dudley, or Queen
                            Jane, but as Lady Jane Grey.</p>
