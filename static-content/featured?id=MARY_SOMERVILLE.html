<p class="" id="N123BB_p">Mary Somerville was an outstanding
                        mathematician and scientist of the Victorian period. Her scientific
                        contributions were doubly significant: not only was she a woman working
                        within a predominantly male domain, but modern science itself was a
                        fledgling field struggling to claim a place in Victorian culture. Mary Somerville&rsquo;s enlightened work
                        helped to establish science as a distinct area of study in Britain, and by the time of her death she was
                        well-known throughout Europe for both
                        her prodigious mathematical talents and her modest, polite, zealously
                        self-motivated personality. Curiously, Mary was not a proficient reader until her early teens, and
                        encountered her first algebraic problem only by chance. Despite the many

<p class="">Mary Fairfax was born on
                            December 26, 1780, not in her own home, but in that of her
                        mother&rsquo;s sister. Her father was a vice-admiral in the British Navy, sent to sea as a midshipman at scarcely
                        ten years of age. As he was so often absent, Mary&rsquo;s mother had decided to accompany him to his port of
                        departure in London. In the throes of her
                        confinement, Mary&rsquo;s mother arrived at
                        her sister&rsquo;s house in Jedburgh, Scotland just in time to give birth to
                            Mary. As Mary&rsquo;s mother was ill following her
                        delivery, she was nursed by her aunt Martha, who also happened
                        to be the mother of her future husband (Neeley 23).</p>
<p class="">Mary grew up in Fife, Scotland,
                        in the &ldquo;quiet, quaint little seaport village&rdquo; (Osen 96) of Burntisland. The Fairfax house
                        and garden were close to the seashore, and Mary spent much of her youth roaming the hillsides and coast
                        near her home, practically ignorant of the existence of mathematics. She
                        wrote in her autobiography: &ldquo;I never cared for dolls, and had no one to play
                        with me&rdquo; (Somerville 18), and her solitary wanderings
                        cultivated her profound fascination with nature. This lifelong love of
                        nature was fueled by her devout faith in God, as her mother, according to
                            Mary&rsquo;s own account, &ldquo;taught me to
                        read the Bible, and to say my prayers morning and evening; otherwise she
                        allowed me to grow up a wild creature&rdquo; (Somerville 17). Her
                        father, upon returning home from one of his long voyages, was dismayed to
                        find her such a &ldquo;savage,&rdquo; hardly able to read or write at ten years of age,
                        and he immediately sent her to a fashionable boarding school in Musselburgh (Osen 97), though
                            Mary was &ldquo;utterly wretched&rdquo; there
                            (Somerville 21) and only remained for one year.</p>
<p class="">After her brief sojourn in formal education, Mary returned home to Burntisland and assumed control over her own education. She
                        studied Latin, arithmetic, and writing, with only the aid of her own
                        resourcefulness. In her mid-teens, the disapproval of her
                        traditionally-minded family supplanted Mary&rsquo;s ever-increasing appetite for education, and she was
                        forced to spend more of her time learning domestic arts. She became quite
                        proficient in playing piano, drawing, and needlework, and had an active
                        social life. It was at a tea party that she encountered her very first
                        algebra problem. Mary and a friend
                        were flipping through a fashion magazine when she spotted some algebraic
                        symbols that kindled her interest, and she resolved to investigate the
                        subject further (Osen 99 &ndash; 100). Although unassertive by
                        nature, Mary eventually managed to
                        obtain and study a copy of Euclid&rsquo;s Elements of Geometry
                        despite familial reproach. Indeed, &ldquo;her mother was appalled and shamed by
                        such aberrant behavior, and the servants were instructed to confiscate Mary&rsquo;s supply of candles so that she
                        could not study at night&rdquo; (Osen 102).</p>
<p class="">In 1804, Mary married her cousin Samuel
                            Greig, a captain in the Russian Navy. Though he had already served with distinction, Mary&rsquo;s parents would not hear of her
                        moving to Russia, so Samuel
                        left active service and became the Russian consol for Britain in
                            London (Patterson 3).
                        Finally removed from the intellectual confines of her conservative family&rsquo;s
                        criticism, Mary was less inhibited in
                        her mathematical studies, though not by much. In the words of her daughter
                            Martha, &ldquo;nothing can be more erroneous than the statement&hellip;
                        that Mr. Greig (Mary's
                        first husband) aided her in her mathematical and other pursuits. Nearly the
                        contrary was the case. Mr. Greig took no interest in science or
                        literature, and possessed in full the prejudice against learned women which
                        was common at that time&rdquo; (Somerville 3). Of the two children
                        she had with Samuel, one died at the age of seven and the
                        other, Woronzow Greig, grew up to be a barrister-at-law. After
                        just three years of marriage, Samuel died in 1807, leaving Mary grief-stricken and unhealthy for
                        several years.</p>
<p class=""> Not having found London particularly agreeable, Mary returned to Burntisland after her first husband's death. Financially
                        independent for the first time in her life, Mary was at liberty to pursue her study of mathematics in
                        earnest. Her interest in nature emboldened her and she also began to study
                        astronomy and natural science. She continued to advance her scientific
                        knowledge, slowly acquiring a small library as well as professional advice.
                        In 1812 she married
                        another cousin, a surgeon named William Somerville, with whom
                        she had three children, though only two survived infancy. In contrast to the
                        behavior of her first husband, Dr. William Somerville was
                        entirely supportive of Mary&rsquo;s efforts
                            (Osen 105). In the early days of their marriage the couple
                        divided their time between Scotland and
                            London, and as their London residence was near the Royal Institution of Great Britain, Mary was able to use its vast resources
                        to further educate herself. Dr. Somerville&rsquo;s connections with
                        the British government incorporated the
                            Somervilles into an animatedly intellectual social circle,
                        and Mary met and befriended many
                        leading mathematicians and astronomers. Though she spent much of her day in
                        private study, her daughter Martha wrote that Mary found &ldquo;gay and cheerful company&hellip; a
                        pleasant relaxation after a hard day&rsquo;s work. My mother never introduced
                        scientific or learned subjects into general conversation. When they were
                        brought forward by others, she talked simply and naturally about them,
                        without the slightest pretension to superior knowledge&rdquo;
                            (Somerville 5).</p>
<p class="">The same humility with which her daughter credited her was reflected in her
                        scientific work. Mary soon became
                        well-known for her comprehensible writing style, despite the complexity of
                        the subject matter, and for her desire to &ldquo;make the laws by which the
                        material world is governed, more familiar&rdquo; (Osen 113). Mary&rsquo;s first and greatest published
                        work was her translation and introduction to Pierre-Simon
                            Laplace&rsquo;s Mecanique C&eacute;leste in 1831. Mary met with the great French mathematician and astronomer in Paris, and in conversation, he told her that &ldquo;I write books that
                        no one can read. There have been only three women who have understood
                        me&mdash;yourself, <a href="featured%3Fid=CAROLINE_HERSCHEL.html">Caroline Herschel</a>, and
                        a Mrs. Greig, of whom I have never
                        been able to learn anything&rdquo; (Chamber 186). Of course, Mary was the first and third of these
                        individuals. Despite others&rsquo; confidence in her ability, Mary was hesitant and undertook the
                        translation in secrecy in order to assure that her work could be destroyed
                        if it were a failure (Osen 107). In her own modest words, she
                        stated that &ldquo;I simply translated Laplace&rsquo;s work from algebra
                        into common language.&rdquo; The English
                        scientist Sir John Herschel immediately proclaimed the work &ldquo;a
                        book for posterity&rdquo; because of Mary&rsquo;s ability to clearly communicate
                        concepts through simple explications entirely lacking condescension (Mary 570). Upon publication, it became
                        an extremely popular mathematical resource, and quickly became a textbook
                        for Cambridge University mathematics
                        students.</p>
<p class="">Mary left England in 1833 due to the health of her husband
                            William. They lived in various locations throughout the
                        continent, mostly in Italy, but Mary was at a great disadvantage, no
                        longer in the thick of the thriving, cutting-edge scientific community of
                            London. She continued her research,
                        however, and wrote a second book, On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences.
                        It was first published in 1834 and was continually reprinted in several British and American editions. This second book was a detailed
                        account of physical phenomena and the many connections among the fields of
                        physical science (Grinstein and Campbell 212). In
                        its first four decades, some fifteen thousand copies of her book were sold,
                        and the tenth edition appeared in 1877, five years after her death
                            (Patterson 193). The widespread acclaim garnered by her
                        book did not go unrecognized, and Mary, along with <a href="featured%3Fid=CAROLINE_HERSCHEL.html">Caroline
                            Herschel</a>, earned scientific distinction in 1835 as the first women
                        elected as honorary members of the Royal Astronomical Society
                            (Patterson 164).</p>
<p class="">Mary&rsquo;s humility, kindness, and work
                        ethic did not diminish with time, regardless of her well-established
                        reputation. Sir Francis Chantrey, a sculptor commissioned by
                        the Royal Astronomical Society to sculpt Mary&rsquo;s portrait bust, recalled a dinner party at which a friend
                        begged Chantrey to introduce her to Mrs. Somerville. Chantrey
                        seated the ladies side by side and perceived, from the ease of their
                        conversation, that they were delighted with each other. He was later
                        bewildered when his friend believed herself to be the victim of a joke,
                        indignantly challenging him, &ldquo;How could you do so? You knew that I did not
                        want to know that Mrs. Somerville; I
                        wanted to know the astronomer: that lady talked of the theatre, the opera,
                        and common things&rdquo; (Mary 569 &ndash;
                        70).</p>
<p class="">In 1848, at the age
                        of sixty-eight, Mary published yet
                        another book, Physical Geography. The pioneering work proved to be yet
                        another success, and Mary anticipated
                        &ldquo;a regional approach to geography rather than one made solely along national
                        or political lines&rdquo; (Patterson 194). It was used extensively in
                        schools and universities for the next fifty years (Grinstein
                        and Campbell 214), and five more editions appeared in her
                        lifetime for a total of approximately sixteen thousand copies sold
                            (Patterson 194).</p>
<p class="">In her eighty-fifth year, Maryshowed
                        no signs of slowing down, and she began her fourth work entitled On
                        Molecular and Microscopic Science. It was published four years later in two
                        volumes, the first delving into &ldquo;small bodies of inanimate matter
                        (molecules)&rdquo; and the second dealing with &ldquo;small bodies of animate matter
                        (microscopic organisms)&rdquo; (Patterson 194). By the time of its
                        publication, however, much of its subject matter was already obsolete, and
                        the reviewers paid more attention to her age and distinction than to the
                        contents. At the seasoned age of eighty-nine, Mary&rsquo;s mind was just as robust as ever
                        and she pursued her last work, an autobiography in collaboration with her
                        daughter Martha. Personal Recollections, published posthumously
                        by her daughter, decidedly omitted distinctly scientific portions of the
                        manuscript, in addition to specific references to people and events deemed
                        uninteresting or inappropriate in context (Grinstein and
                            Campbell 214).</p>
<p class="">After the death of her second husband William in 1860, Mary spent the remainder of her days in
                            Italy, with only a few brief visits
                        to England and around Europe. Her old age was rather a forlorn time for
                        her, not only due to the death of her beloved husband, but also because of
                        the earth-shattering blow that came with the death of her middle-aged son
                            Woronzow in 1865 (Patterson 194). In 1871, after the death of
                        her close friend Sir John Herschel, she wrote that &ldquo;few of my
                        early friends now remain&mdash;I am nearly left alone&rdquo; (Somerville
                        361). She became deaf and weak in her final years, though she continued
                        nonetheless in her perpetual dedication to self-improvement. Her mind
                        remained intact and she would &ldquo;read books on the higher algebra for four or
                        five hours in the morning, even to solve problems&rdquo; (Perl 92).
                        She died peacefully at the age of ninety-two, and up until the day she died
                        she worked on math problems to amuse herself (Patterson 195).
                            Mary Somerville&rsquo;s dedication to
                        knowledge and her everlasting love of nature pervades all the her works. In
                        the words of her daughter Martha, &ldquo;everything in nature spoke
                        to her of that great God who created all things, the grand and sublimely
                        beautiful as well as the exquisite loveliness of minute objects. Above all,
                        in the laws which science unveils, step by step, she found ever renewed
                        motives for the love and adoration of their Author and Sustainer&rdquo;
                            (Somerville 5).</p>
