<p class="" id="N1298E_p">In 1853, the
                        twenty-eight-year-old Adelaide Anne
                            Procter wrote a letter describing a peasant&rsquo;s engagement party
                        she had attended in Italy:</p>
<p class="">"We have been to a ball, of which I must give you a description. Last
                        Tuesday&hellip; we heard very distinctly a band of music, which rather excited my
                        astonishment&hellip; Emily said, &lsquo;Oh! That band is playing at the
                        farmer&rsquo;s near here. The daughter is fianc&eacute;e to-day, and they have a ball.&rsquo; I
                        said, &lsquo;I wish I was going!&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied she, &lsquo;the farmer&rsquo;s wife did call
                        to invite us.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then, I shall certainly go,&rsquo; I exclaimed&hellip; We were received
                        with great enthusiasm; the only drawback being, that no one spoke French&hellip; I
                        began to be afraid that some idea of our dignity might prevent my getting a
                        partner; so, by Madame B.&rsquo;s advice, I went up to the bride, and
                        offered to dance with her&hellip; My [other] partner was a little man, like
                            Perrot, and very proud of his dancing. He cut in the air
                        and twisted about, until I was out of breath, though my attempts to imitate
                        him were feeble in the extreme&hellip; after seven or eight dances, I was obliged
                        to sit down. We stayed till nine, and I was so dead beat with the heat that
                        I could hardly crawl about the house&hellip; it is so long since I have danced.&rdquo;
                            &ndash;Dickens, xvii-xix</p>
<p class="">Adelaide Anne Procter&rsquo;s exuberance in
                        this anecdote conflicts with the general impression of a severe or
                        meditative character, reflected in her role as a poet, advocate for women&rsquo;s
                        rights, and member of a prominent literary family. A friend of the family
                        described the young Procter as
                        possessing a &ldquo;doomed&rdquo; look about her, manifested in a &ldquo;marked brow over
                        heavy blue eyes" and a &ldquo;mournful expression for a little child&rdquo;
                            (Gregory, Life and Work [LW], 5). However, Charles
                            Dickens provides us with a contrasting view of Procter&rsquo;s character as he writes that
                        even on her deathbed &ldquo;her old cheerfulness never quitted her&rdquo;
                            (Dickens, xxiii). Though Dickens proved to be
                        a prominent advocate for Procter and
                        her works, one must wonder what he saw in the young lady that few others
                        did. These markedly different perceptions of Adelaide Anne Procter&rsquo;s personality
                        only begin to relate all the ways she was, and is today, perceived by
                        critics and friends alike. </p>
<p class="">Adelaide was born into the
                            Procter family in London
                        on October 30, 1825, and she &ldquo;grew up amid surroundings
                        calculated to develop her literary taste&rdquo; (Lee, 1). Many family
                        friends perceived that she had a serious demeanor, as they would have
                        expected of the daughter of a well-respected poet. Her father, Bryan
                            Waller Procter, who published under the name Barry
                            Cornwall, was a lawyer and a poet so well regarded that he has
                        prominent placement in several short obituaries of his daughter. Procter&rsquo;s mother encouraged her
                        daughter&rsquo;s interest in poetry by copying poems into a small album, which the
                        young girl carried &ldquo;about like another little girl might have carried a
                        doll&rdquo; (Dickens, xvi). Procter grew up surrounded by important figures of literature
                        and reform, such as William Makepeace Thackery, Charles
                            Dickens, Thomas Carlyle, and M. P. Benjamin
                            Leigh Smith (Hoeckley, 2); however, as her
                        experience at the engagement party documents, she also enjoyed associating
                        with people outside her elite circle, and took pleasure in non-literary
                        pursuits.</p>
<p class="">Despite Procter&rsquo;s familiarity with
                        the literary world, she refused to rely on her connections as she sought
                        publication. She even submitted her poetry to Dickens&rsquo;
                        publication, Household Words, under the pseudonym &ldquo;Miss
                        Berwick&rdquo; (2). Her use of a female name (unlike authors such as
                            Marian Evans and the <a href="featured%3Fid=CHARLOTTE_BRONTE.html">Bront&euml;</a> sisters who used masculine pen names) can be seen as an
                        early indication of her later campaigns for women&rsquo;s rights, becaue she
                        promoted women&rsquo;s entrance into the male-dominated sphere of publication.
                            Dickens himself was unaware that Miss Berwick,
                        whose poetry he frequently published, was actually Adelaide Anne Procter, the daughter of
                        a long-time family friend. One winter day in 1854, as he visited with the
                            Procter family, he warmly praised the unknown female poet
                        whose work he had been publishing for two years (2). The following evening,
                        he learned that he had been praising &ldquo;Miss Berwick&rdquo; in her
                        presence (2). Until then, Dickens and the Household Words staff
                        had fantasized that this mysterious Miss Berwick was a
                        governess. He had so fully invented her character that his &ldquo;mother was not a
                        more real personage to [him], than Miss Berwick the governess
                        became&rdquo; (Dickens, xiv), but he transferred his admiration for
                            &ldquo;Miss Berwick&rdquo; to Miss
                            Procter. Her use of a pseudonym &ldquo;strikingly illustrates the
                        honesty, independence, and quiet dignity, of the lady&rsquo;s character&rdquo; (xiv-xv)
                        because she relied on her talent, rather than her connections, to advance
                        her art.</p>
<p class="">Dickens&rsquo; appreciation for Procter&rsquo;s poetry continued after he discovered her identity, and
                        over time she became his most published author (Gregory, A. Procter, 1). Dickens
                        published her poetry not only in Household Words, but also All the Year
                        Round, another of his well-circulated periodicals (Hoeckley, 2;
                            Lee, 1). Although very few periodicals besides
                            Dickens&rsquo; featured her work (Drain, 2), she had
                        ample opportunity to publish her poetry through Dickens. She
                        was the only poet whom he featured in his Christmas edition.
                            (Gregory, LW, 228). She published her own two-volume book
                        of poetry, Legends and Lyrics, in May of 1858, and both volumes were reprinted
                        in multiple editions. </p>
<p class="">Although Procter found professional
                        success as an artist, her poetic ability is only one of many traits
                        distinguishing her from most Victorian women. She was raised as a
                        Protestant, but she and her sisters converted to Catholicism in 1851, possibly influenced
                        by an Italian aunt (Hoeckley, 2). This conversion is
                        significant: given the strong anti-Catholic sentiments throughout England at this time, her conversion
                        shows strength of character. Some scholars speculate, however, that she had
                        already secretly adopted Catholicism two years earlier (Drain,
                        2), when she was twenty-four. Adelaidemay have waited to announce her decision until she had
                        her sisters&rsquo; support because her conversion complicated the initially strong
                        relationship between herself and her father (Gregory, LW, 10).
                        But whether she feared cultural or familial disapproval, her delay may
                        detract from her iconic position as an independent woman. However, her
                        Catholic faith led her directly to passionate involvement with social work,
                        arguably one of her most progressive achievements.</p>
<p class="">Because of widespread bigotry against Catholics, Procter&rsquo;s conversion aligned her with
                        oppressed sectors of society, including working-class Irish Catholics (11). She supported the Providence
                        Row Night Refuge, which aided predominantly Catholic homeless women and
                        children (11). Her concern for the disenfranchised also led her to the
                        struggle for women&rsquo;s rights, a cause she championed throughout her life. She
                        associated with other women who combined their artistic and cultural
                        interests with the advancement of women&rsquo;s causes. These women frequently met
                        in each other&rsquo;s homes to discuss marriage and property laws in the context
                        of women&rsquo;s lives (Hoeckley, 3). Though they often met sexist
                        criticism meant to trivialize their cause (3), that attention also indicated
                        that their ideas posed a threat to the societal status quo.</p>
<p class="">Procter used her success as a poet to
                        advance the causes for which she fought. Beyond writing for personal
                        enjoyment, she also dedicated her literary efforts to helping women in the
                        workplace. She united her passions for writing and reform through her work
                        in The English Woman&rsquo;s Journal, which
                        fought for women&rsquo;s equality in education, employment, and property rights
                        (3). She used her poetic skills to provide a voice for the Catholic widows
                        and orphans she was helping through the Providence Row Night Refuge. While
                        working to support the Society to Promote the Employment of Women (SPEW),
                        she published <span class="subtitle ">
                            <em>Victoria Regia: a Volume of Original Contributions in
                                Poetry and Prose</em>
                        </span> (3-4). This publication supported the cause of female employment by
                        using a printing company which exclusively employed women (4). Procter&rsquo;s poetic success was not only
                        a personal victory, but also a way for her to advance her belief in social
                        justice.</p>
<p class="">Despite her prolific publication, critical reception of her poetry was and
                        remains highly ambivalent. Even Dickens, Procter&rsquo;s most enthusiastic advocate,
                        was uneasy about the social aspects of her poetry. While declaring his
                        admiration for her style, he evinced some apprehension about those social
                        aspects (Gregory, LW, 197). He praised her philanthropic work
                        but avoided mentioning her official positions within liberal organizations
                        (197). Beyond her possibly controversial topics, a contemporary biographer
                        writes that her style of poetry was often &ldquo;not only sentimental but also
                        formally simplistic&rdquo; (Hoeckley, 5). Procter
                        herself admitted that &ldquo;Papa is a poet. I only write verses&rdquo;
                            (Drain, 3). Despite its formal uninventiveness, her poetry
                        was popular because of its &ldquo;invariably simple and direct language and
                        strongly affective rhetoric. This simplicity&hellip; masks a complexity of thought
                        and feeling&rdquo; (Gregory, LW, 3-4). Critiques of her work,
                        accompanied with Procter&rsquo;s own
                        humility, suggest that her poetry&rsquo;s significance comes from its content
                        rather than its form or style.</p>
<p class="">Procter&rsquo;s relationships within
                        feminist societies have led to speculations about her sexuality. Little is
                        known about her romantic and sexual liaisons. She was engaged at least once,
                        according to a letter from William Makepeace Thackeray, and
                        there is additional evidence that she was engaged to a man who devastated
                        her by breaking the engagement (21, 24). This latter incident probably
                        occurred two years before the Thackeray letter, although the
                        dating and details are so uncertain that this may be the same man (21, 24).
                        Despite these documented heterosexual relationships, rumors of her
                        lesbianism have persisted. Her friendship with Matilda M. Hays,
                        a co-editor of The English Woman&rsquo;s
                        Journal, may not have been platonic: &ldquo;She dedicated the &lsquo;First Series&rsquo; of
                        Legends and Lyrics to &lsquo;Matilda M. Hays&rsquo;. On the 23
                            January 1858
                        Procter wrote a poem titled &lsquo;To
                        M.M.H&rsquo;&hellip;It is a poem which expresses love for Hays&hellip; who dressed
                        in men&rsquo;s clothes and had lived with [a woman] in Rome&rdquo; (24-25). Other than the vaguely erotic nature of several of
                        her poems (254), there is little evidence about her romantic or sexual
                        life.</p>
<p class="">The intense activity and ceaseless work that made Procter remarkable contributed to her
                        early death at the age of thirty-eight. She was confined to her bed for the
                        last fifteen months of her short life as she suffered from tuberculosis. It
                        is highly possible that her work among the sick exposed her to the
                        tuberculosis that killed her, although her intense work ethic rendered her
                        physically ill-equipped to fight the disease (Hoeckley, 5). She
                        died in the presence of her mother and sister in London at the age of thirty-eight (Dickens,
                        xxiv).</p>
<p class="">Despite her passionate activism, her obituaries hailed her importance as a
                        poet and as her father&rsquo;s literary heir. Her obituary in The Examiner lists
                        her poetic achievements with no mention of her social importance (The
                        Examiner). It fallaciously states that she died unexpectedly, despite her
                        fifteen months on bed rest (The Examiner). Her obituary in Liverpool Mercury Etc. falsely reports that she died &ldquo;at
                        about thirty years of age&rdquo; (Liverpool).
                        Both of these inconsistencies romanticize her premature death. In another
                        obituary, published by an Irish
                        newspaper, Procter&rsquo;s Catholic faith
                        is celebrated above her achievements; the author claims that &ldquo;The religious
                        no less than the literary world has good cause to lament [her] loss&rdquo;
                        (Freeman&rsquo;s). These early accounts of her life omit her social reform, while
                        contemporary biographers emphasize her importance as a woman&rsquo;s advocate
                        above her merit as a poet. As society has recognized the importance of
                        women&rsquo;s rights, this aspect of Procter&rsquo;s life has been more celebrated. These different
                        perceptions are possible because Procter was such a rich character, with a young woman&rsquo;s
                        cheerfulness, a poet&rsquo;s intensity, an artistic vision, and a passion for
                        reform. </p>
