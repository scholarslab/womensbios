      <b>
       <i>The Friendships of Women.</i>
      </b>
      3d ed.,
      
       Boston:
       Roberts,
       1867;
       1868;
       1870;
       1872;
       1875;
       1882;
       1885.
      
      <p class="notepara">Largely a treatise on the subject, a prototype of social psychology in a way, with 
       many pages of brief biographical history (416 pages excluding front matter).  Dedicated to Anna Cabot Lodge.  "Works by the Same Author": The Poetry of the Orient; A Critical
       History of the Doctrine of a Future Life; The Genius of Solitude.  The table of contents runs for four close-typed
       pages; we reproduce the list for searching purposes without tagging the names.  The scope is international and 
       overwhelmingly Western, with an interesting anachronism and willingness to include Biblical, mythic or legendary 
       persons.  Some startling 
       assertions include the friendship of Augusta and Lord Byron; the generally conservative admiration of women is 
       characterized in the headings at the end advising women to avoid politics; both men and women should eschew power.  Certain persons such as Elizabeth Barrett Browning 
       appear more than once.  After sections affirming the significant history of female friendship (HAVE WOMEN NO FRIENDSHIPS?) and defining
       his concept (FRIENDSHIP INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE TIES OF BLOOD, FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN), by page 47 the text accumulates very short biographies
       (often of one paragraph, but sometimes of several): FRIENDSHIPS OF MOTHERS AND SONS  Cornelia and the Gracchi. Olympias and Alexander.
