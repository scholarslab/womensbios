<p class="">Frances Power Cobbe, born in Dublin in December 1822, left behind a rich legacy as
                        a journalist, women&rsquo;s rights activist, and social reformer when she passed
                        away in April 1904.
                            Frances Power Cobbe was in many
                        ways a remarkable woman. Living in the Victorian age when women had limited
                        access to gainful employment and women writers were still something to be
                        scorned, Cobbe was a prolific author
                        and earned a living as a journalist for such reputable newspapers as <span class="subtitle ">
                            <em>The Economist</em>
                        </span>, <span class="subtitle ">
                            <em>The Spectator</em>
                        </span>, <span class="subtitle ">
                            <em> The Contemporary Review </em>
                        </span>, and <span class="subtitle ">
                            <em>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</em>
                        </span>. For a time, she was also the second leader writer for <span class="subtitle ">
                            <em>The Echo</em>
                        </span>. Cobbe&rsquo;s role as a contributor
                        to these newspapers afforded her a unique stage from which to campaign on
                        behalf of women&rsquo;s suffrage, better educational opportunities for women and
                        the poor, and the anti-vivisection movement. </p>
<p class="">Frances Power Cobbe began exercising her
                        philanthropic spirit at an early age. The only daughter of Frances Conway Cobbe and Charles Cobbe, she was born into a landowning Anglo-Irish family
                        of some wealth and distinction. Cobbe
                        therefore had a comfortable middle-class upbringing, and it provided her
                        with opportunities to help those in need. On her father&rsquo;s Newberry estate, for example, lived poor Irish tenants whose children the young
                            Frances taught and cared for.
                            Deidre Rafferty, in a short biography of Cobbe, grounds Cobbe's early philanthropic spirit on a
                        strong sense of noblesse oblige. That is, for the privileged Cobbe there was a sense of duty and
                        obligation towards the less fortunate. It was possibly this same sense of
                        duty and obligation that influenced and compelled her interest in reform
                        movements. In her autobiography <em>Life of Frances Power Cobbe</em>, she suggests such
                        a motivation in regards to her interest in the campaign against domestic
                        violence: &ldquo;in 1878
                        I was by chance reading a newspaper in which a series of frightful cases of
                        this kind were recorded&hellip;I got up out of my armchair, half dazed, and said to
                        myself: &lsquo;I will never rest till I have tried what I can do to stop this'&rdquo;
                        (535). By 1881,
                            Cobbe had articulated this driving
                        sense of duty in a new way. She explains in <em>Duties of
                            Women</em> that &ldquo;it is quite possible to erect a general scheme of duty
                        on the sole ground of the inherent necessary rightfulness of one class of
                        actions and sentiments, and wrongfulness of another&hellip;&rdquo; (29).</p>
<p class="">As the only daughter in a family of five children, Cobbe also experienced another kind of
                        duty and obligation&mdash;one generally expected from the women of her time.
                        As a result of her mother&rsquo;s grave illness, Cobbe returned home from her school in Brighton to take over the household chores. After her
                        mother, Frances Cobbe Conway, died in 1847, when Cobbe was twenty-five, the task of
                        running the household was left to her, and in the end she became her
                        father&rsquo;s caretaker and companion until his death in 1857. While Cobbe was aware of the gender
                        implications of her domestic duty to her father, she nevertheless asserts in
                        her 1865 work &ldquo;The
                        Limits of Obedience in Daughters&rdquo; that while parents have a right to demand
                        self-sacrifice from their children, the filial duty should be shared equally
                        by male and female children (<em>Women</em>, 105).</p>
<p class="">While Cobbe&rsquo;s reform activities may have
                        been compelled by a sense of obligation and duty, her feminist beliefs were
                        greatly influenced by the works of the transcendentalist Theodore
                            Parker, and particularly his <em>Discourse of True
                            Religion</em>. Parker&rsquo;s book &ldquo;supported her belief in a
                        rational God whose moral law was revealed through human intuition&rdquo; (<em>Women</em>, 98). Parker also articulated
                        that &ldquo;in God, the parent of Good, we have both parents in one&rdquo; (<em>Frances Power Cobbe</em>, 64); that is, God is both
                        father and mother. Parker&rsquo;s beliefs contrasted sharply with
                        deeply patriarchal Victorian England, and equally contrasted with
                            Cobbe&rsquo;s household, which was headed by a dominating father. </p>
<p class="">Frances Cobbe&rsquo;s experiences with her
                        father, Charles Cobbe, whom she described as having a &ldquo;fiery
                        temper and despotic will&rdquo; (<em>Life</em>, 207), equally
                        influenced her opinions about patriarchy and the vulnerable position of
                        women in Victorian society. Cobbe had a
                        distant and sometimes tense relationship with her father. In raising his
                        children, Charles Cobbe had exhibited a great deal of concern
                        in regards to the welfare and education of his four sons, but spared little
                        attention for Frances. His diary, begun
                        shortly after her birth and continued till his death in 1857, contained only
                        twenty-five mentions of his only daughter (<em>Frances Power
                            Cobbe</em>, 35). Father and daughter were further estranged when Frances confessed her belief in theism
                        shortly after her mother&rsquo;s death. From an early age Cobbe had been grappling with her belief
                        in Christianity, and had turned to Theodore Parker&rsquo;s
                        <em>Discourse of True Religion</em>. But in a devoutly
                        evangelical family that had produced five arch-bishops and that regularly
                        shared morning prayers, Frances's
                        theism was not well received. In 1853
                        Charles Cobbe responded by sending his daughter to live with an
                        older brother at a farm in Donegal, an
                        isolated and lonely county. Frances
                        resided in Donegal for a year until she
                        was recalled by her father to resume her domestic duties at the
                            Cobbe household. Cobbe
                        later developed a form of deism, and actually campaigned against atheism and
                        Darwinian ethics later in her life. In 1855 and 1857, Cobbe published the two parts of her first book, <em>The Theory of Intuitive Morals</em>. Fearing her father's
                        reaction, she had the book published anonymously. </p>
<p class="">Cobbe&rsquo;s father passed away in 1857 and though his death
                        may have freed Cobbe from his severity,
                        it also left her nearly impoverished. She received &pound;200 per annum and lost
                        her father&rsquo;s house to her brother. Biographer Deidre Rafferty
                        suggests that the minimal inheritance &ldquo;indicated that her father had not
                        wished that she would live independently.&rdquo; Rather he &ldquo;had expected that
                            Frances would remain at Newbridge as the guest of her brother and
                        sister-in-law following his death&rdquo; (<em>Women</em>, 100).
                            Cobbe however never fulfilled this
                        expectation. Shortly after her father&rsquo;s death she departed on a tour of Europe and the Middle East. To prepare for her journey, Cobbe actually cut off all her hair so
                        that she would not need to bring a lady&rsquo;s maid with her. During this trip,
                        she made the acquaintance of a group of feminists in Rome, including <a href="featured%3Fid=MARY_SOMERVILLE.html">Mary
                            Somerville</a> and Harriet Hosmer. </p>
<p class="">Upon her return to England in 1858, Cobbe moved to Bristol and began living with Mary
                            Carpenter, a reformer. During this time she assisted
                            Carpenter with her work at the Red Lodge Reformatory for
                        delinquent girls, where she was exposed to the plight of the lower classes.
                            Cobbe believed this experience was integral to the
                        development of her political and social passions. However, by the end of
                            1859 she had
                        ended her working and living relationship with Carpenter. Cobbe had found Carpenter&rsquo;s
                        austere lifestyle too demanding and unenriching. Cobbe later found a more pleasant living
                        environment in London with the Welsh sculptor Mary Lloyd,
                        whom she met in Rome in 1858. In the <em>Life of Frances Power Cobbe</em>, Cobbe admits that with Lloyd
                        she &ldquo;had once more a home and a most happy one&rdquo; (<em>Life</em>, 32). The two women began their life-long co-habitation and
                        relationship in 1860. The nature of the relationship is not exactly clear,
                        as Cobbe was very protective of her
                        private life and her autobiography sheds minimal light on it. </p>
<p class="">During the 1860s,
                            Cobbe campaigned extensively for
                        women&rsquo;s rights and against vivisection, the practice of performing surgery
                        on living animals for scientific purposes. In her influential article
                        &ldquo;Celibacy vs. Marriage&rdquo; which appeared in <em>Fraser&rsquo;s
                            Magazine</em> in 1862, Cobbe argued
                        that the single life for females is preferable to marriage until the two
                        sexes are truly equal and marriage can be an institution based solely on
                        love. In 1863,
                            Cobbe began her campaign against
                        vivisection. Cobbe saw feminism and the
                        anti-vivisection movement as inextricably linked. Both movements sought to
                        protect vulnerable beings from exploitation. Cobbe believed adamantly in the autonomy of women, but also
                        believed in innate differences between the sexes. Though she campaigned for
                        rights for women, she also upheld the traditional view of feminine traits
                        like purity and tenderness. This might appear to be a contradiction today,
                        and even at the time of Cobbe&rsquo;s death
                        her breed of feminism was somewhat old-fashioned. Even though her writing
                        extols conventionally feminine characteristics, Cobbe herself, as an obstinate and
                        zealous reformer, was known to be anything but docile and ladylike. Cobbe was a free-thinker, an individual,
                        and a rebel in many ways. She stuck to her convictions and persistently
                        pursued her goals. Her obituary, published in <em>The London Times</em>, took notice of this:
                        &ldquo;Yet to a masculine vigor and to what was, in many respects, a decidedly
                        masculine turn of mind she joined an intensely womanly sympathy, which made
                        her a practical and most active philanthropist, whose chief mission in life
                        it was to show a tender solicitude alike for her own sex and for the dumb
                        creation&rdquo; (<em>London
                            Times</em>, 8). Cobbe thought that
                        in an equal society, women would naturally use their abilities for
                        philanthropic causes. </p>
<p class="">In 1875,
                            Cobbe established the Victoria Street Society, which was initially known as the Society
                        for Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection and later known as the
                        National Anti-Vivisection Society. In 1876, the Cruelty to Animals Act was passed.
                            Cobbe was outraged, as she felt the
                        Act actually facilitated the practice of vivisection. She would campaign for
                        the repeal of this act until her retirement in 1884.</p>
<p class="">In 1878, Cobbe wrote the revolutionary and
                        influential &ldquo;Wife Torture in England.&rdquo;
                        This article examined the prevalence of domestic violence and called for the
                        right of a wife to separate from an abusive husband and to retain child
                        custody. At the time, a husband convicted of assault was punished, but no
                        one thought about the position of the abused wife. Many see this article as
                        the impetus for the enactment of the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1878 which allowed wives
                        to separate from abusive husbands while also claiming custody of their
                        children. In her autobiography Cobbe
                        confesses that &ldquo;the part of my work for women, however, to which I look back
                        upon with most satisfaction was that in which I labored to obtain protection
                        for unhappy wives, beaten, mangled, mutilated, or trampled upon by brutal
                        husbands&rdquo; (<em>Life</em>, 534).</p>
<p class="">In 1884, Cobbe retired and moved to Hengwrt in Wales with Mary Lloyd. Money left to Cobbe upon the death of the widow of a
                        staunch anti-vivisectionist allowed her and Lloyd to live a
                        comfortable life in their retirement. Cobbe wrote her autobiography in 1894, and <em>The New York Times</em> advertised it as
                        containing &ldquo;reminiscences of many distinguished persons, including
                            Tennyson, Browning, Gladstone,
                            Bright, Matthew Arnold, Theodore
                            Parker, Lord Shaftesbury, Jowett,
                            Walter Savage Landor, Lady Byron,
                            Adolphus Trollope, George Eliot, John
                            Stuart Mill, <a href="featured%3Fid=MARY_SOMERVILLE.html">Mrs.
                            Somerville</a>, Fanny Kemble, Darwin, and
                            Sir Charles Lyell&rdquo; (<em>New York Times</em>, 23). </p>
<p class="">Mary Lloyd died in 1896, leaving Cobbe
                        alone and distraught. By her death on April 5, 1904, Cobbe&rsquo;s life had spanned the entire
                        Victorian era. The Reverend Frederic Rowland Marvin wrote in
                        the <em>New York Times</em>,
                        &ldquo;literature has lost an ornament and the world a true friend&rdquo;
                            (Marvin). Cobbe was
                        terrified of being buried alive, so she requested that her windpipe and
                        arteries in her neck be severed prior to burial. The <em>Washington Post</em> snidely called
                        this &ldquo;an astonishing illogicality from one who was so bitterly opposed to
                        vivisection&rdquo; (<em>Washington
                            Post</em>, B3). Cobbe was buried next to her beloved life
                        partner in Hengwrt.</p>
