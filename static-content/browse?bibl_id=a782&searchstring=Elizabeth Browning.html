<div class="para">Available in a 1992 facsimile by The Methodist Publishing House.  It was edited by John A. Vickers, who added an Editorial
       Note identifying Zachariah Taft (1772-1848) as an itinerant Wesleyan who continued to advocate women's preaching, including
       that of his wife Mary Barritt, even when it lost its official sanction.  Taft's preface to volume one indicates that he wants 
       to preserve records that have been suppressed because most "Biographers and Editors of Magazines, are enemies to female preaching" (ii).
       According to Taft, John Wesley "knew that it made no difference whether the servant of God...was male or female" (iii).  "From the
       pages of History, we learn that <i>women</i> have moved in the most exalted spheres, and chived the most astonishing
       exploits" (vi), as Taft goes on to illustrate, citing various divines. He has introduced some examples of the living.  The biographies
       include correspondence, and may reproduce a journal (e.g. Mary Holder's pp. 101-26). End of vol. 1 lists errata; lists other books
       by Taft, and the facsimile edition adds an appendix noting Taft's own annotations for a planned second edition.  Vol. 2 begins
       with frontispiece portrait of Taft, another preface arguing for women's preaching ("no female preaches for hire" but
       all must overcome resistance (ix-x). He notes the "favourable reception of the first volume" (xiv), and reprints at the beginning
       some of the verse communications he received in response (xvi-xxi).  Chapters may begin with the name as the first words of a first
       sentence, and/or they may have a parenthetical statement about the name in italics below the title name, e.g. Miss Sarah Eland. (Now Mrs. De Putron.)</div>
