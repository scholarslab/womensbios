                        charitable influence extended across the United Kingdom and Europe. The first publicly recognized female philanthropist, she organized Ladies' Committees that fought to reform the

<p class="">Elizabeth Gurney was born May 21,
                            1780 in a distinguished home on Magdalen Street in Norwich,
                        an important center for England's
                        prosperous cloth trade. Known in the family as Betsy, she was the fourth of twelve children born to John
                            Gurney
                            (1749-1809) and
                            Catherine Bell (1754-1792). Her father was the heir in a family of
                        successful wool merchants and a partner in Gurneys Bank. Socially
                        established by wealth, both John and Catherine,
                        great-granddaughter of the Quaker
                        theologian Robert Barclay, were from old families in the
                        Society of Friends. Popular and socially mobile within the community of
                        Norwich, they followed the broad tenets of their inherited Quaker faith, but
                        also enjoyed intellectual company and cultural pursuits outside of the
                        ascetic restrictions of Plain Quakerism. The Gurneys attended weekly
                        Meeting and Catherine read passages from the Bible to her children daily,
                        while also instructing them in a worldly academic curriculum which included
                        French, Latin, natural sciences, mathematics, modern history, geography, and
                        the arts (Rose, 6).</p>
<p class="">Collective
                        biographies before 1940 unanimously describe the fair-haired,
                            blue-eyed little Betsy as a child of angelic temperament, based on
                        a detail from her mother's private correspondence: "My dove-like Betsy
                            scarcely offends" (qtd. in <em>Memoir</em>, 15). She
                        enjoyed taking walks in the garden with her mother and joined Catherine when
                        she visited neighboring cottages to carry them gifts of food&mdash;the customs of
                        charity in that era and after. Clara Balfour's
                        collective biography lauds the "moral heroism" of Elizabeth Fry, a virtue
                        she cites as being inherent to Betsy's nature from her earliest years: </p>
<p class="block">[She] exhibited
                            in childhood sweet indications of the excellence that would distinguish
                            her riper years. Entirely free from selfishness, her great delight was
                            to promote the happiness of those around her; to this end her sweet
                            temper, vivacity, and intelligence must have greatly contributed.
                        (339-40)</p>
<p class="">In her more recent biography, June
                            Rose diagnoses an aspect of sullenness in young
                        Betsy's personality by probing her close attachment to her mother:</p>
<p class="block">From her
                            birth in 1780 until she was six, a new brother or sister
                            arrived every year&hellip;.
                        Betsy obviously felt a
                            deep sense of unease, although Catherine Gurney tried conscientiously to "enjoy each child
                            individually."(4)</p>
<p class="">Betsy also was an acutely imaginative child, sensitive to her mother's gloomy
                        dictation from the Old Testament. Her personal journal&mdash;Elizabeth Fry was a
                        consummate diarist throughout her life&mdash;shows a child (one amongst ten now)
                        desperate to mitigate or control her fears, wishing that "two
                            large walls might crush us all together that we might die at once and
                            thus avoid the misery of each other's death" (<em>Memoir</em>, 22). Her nervousness manifested in a terror of water,
                        bathing, sudden noises and significantly, the dark. Betsy
                        languished in &ldquo;delicate health&rdquo; and was unable to focus on her lessons, a
                        marked outcast from her lively and adept siblings. She recalls: "Having
                            the name of being stupid, really tended to make me so and discouraged my
                            efforts to learn" (<em>Memoir</em>, 21). Her
                        resistance and obstinacy became pronounced: "If I am bid to do a thing, my spirit
                            revolts; if I am asked to do a thing I am willing" (<em>Memoir</em>, 36). Yet it is worth noting that years
                        later, her system of discipline at Newgate would rest upon these two insights: Treating inmates as
                        subhuman only perpetuates their degradation; and, most female prisoners will
                        agree to a system of self-reformation if asked.</p>
<p class="">If the collective biographies acknowledge Betsy's less-than-angelic side,
                        they use the same method of positive spin I employed in the previous
                        sentence: the suffering inspires her mission to help other sufferers. This
                        tradition of cleaned-up persona-crafting was begun by her daughters, Katherine and Rachel, who edited her memoir. Large sections of journal
                        entries are evaluated in a conspicuous effort to frame their mother's
                        character in the best light:</p>
<p class="block">In contemplating her peculiar gifts, it is wonderful
                        to observe the adaptation of her natural qualities to her future career; and
                        how, through the transforming power of divine grace, each one became
                        subservient to the highest purposes. Her natural timidity changed to the
                        opposite virtue of courage...The touch of obstinacy she displayed as a
                        child, became that finely tempered decision and firmness, which enabled her
                        to execute her projects for the good of her fellow creatures. That which was
                        in childhood something not unlike cunning, ripened into the most uncommon
                        penetration, long-sightedness, and skill in influencing the minds of those
                        around her. Her disinclination to the common methods of learning, appeared
                        to be connected with much original thought, and a mind acting on its own
                        resources; for she certainly always possessed more genius and ready, quick
                        comprehension, than application or argument. (<em>Memoir</em>, 27-8)</p>
<p class="">Recasting Betsy's early flaws into tests of fortitude allowed editors to
                        construct the adult paragon, Elizabeth Fry. As June
                            Rose points out&mdash;from extensive research of original Fry
                        manuscripts&mdash;her daughters also corrected the egregious spelling and
                        grammatical errors that followed from her resistance to instruction. </p>
<p class="">When Betsy was
                        thirteen, her beloved mother died. She sank into a deeper
                        sense of isolation and depression. The family was affected by her bouts of
                        extreme moodiness; consulting siblings&rsquo; journals, Rose finds an entry by Louisa that is indicative of the
                        tension in the Gurney household: "We are all afraid of her now, which is very
                            shocking...Dearest Betsy! She seems to have no
                            one for her friend, for none of us are intimate with her (12).
                        Betsy appears to have turned inward in her need for a confidante; her
                        journal records acute introspection. In part, this became an obsession with
                        self-improvement. John Gurney was
                        particularly liberal as the single parent of his family, allowing his
                        children to engage in what entertainments they pleased and mix in
                        ideologically diverse company. All seven of the
                        Gurney daughters were attractive and graceful; Betsy received her share of
                        attention, not all of which she disliked. Yet every pleasure recorded in her
                        journal is closely followed by highly critical self-scrutiny:</p>

<p class="">In her recent biography, June Rose reveals that
                        these passions drove Elizabeth Fry throughout her life, yet short collective
                        biographies account for this temperamental conflict as a stage in her
                        development toward religious devotion.</p>
<p class="">At age seventeen, Betsy had yet to connect her struggle to improve herself
                        with distinct ideas about religion; she was still far from the heroine
                        revered in contemporary biographies as a devoted Plain Quaker. Many editors cross this bridge with
                        amazing speed. Clara Balfour's maneuvering is
                        most extreme:</p>
<p class="block">Though full of warm benevolence and good desires, she was,
                        up to this time, a stranger to the converting and sanctifying influences of
                        high-toned religion. Indeed, the gaiety of her disposition induced her
                        rather to delight in the pleasures of the world, which indeed her many
                        talents, gifts, and personal graces, eminently fitted her to enjoy and to
                        adorn. Being, however, the subject of illness, she was led to reflect on the
                        transitory and unworthy character of all worldly pursuits and enjoyments,
                        and to give herself, and all the powers she had been endowed with,
                        unreservedly to God. From this time her conduct became that of a decided and
                        eminent Christian. (340-1)</p>
<p class="">Samuel Mossman's biographical sketch of
                        Elizabeth Fry as a &ldquo;gem of womanhood&rdquo; is noteworthy for his evasiveness
                        while entirely rewriting the person revealed in her journals:</p>
<p class="block">Years passed on with few changes but such as come with
                        the advance of time in the career of a young woman. During many years she
                        devoted herself to religious studies, and canvassed with a clear judgment
                        the peculiar tenets of the sect in which she had been nurtured. She kept a
                        diary of the impressions and doubts she entertained, but ultimately embraced
                        the faith of her father. (69)</p>
<p class="">collective biographies that do provide a more complete picture of Elizabeth
                        Fry&rsquo;s struggle between worldly and religious influences still contain an
                        element that appears across the board: all presenters in these collections
                        mark an absolute reformation of character, so that the adult heroine
                        retained no unworthy qualities. </p>
<p class="">One
                        significant figure in Betsy's path towards Plain Quakerism was William Savery, an American Quakerminister. Hearing him preach was a revelatory
                        experience for the impressionable young woman: &ldquo;Today
                            I felt <em>that there is a God</em>&mdash;I have been
                            devotional &amp; my mind has been led away from the follies it mostly is
                            wrapped up in&mdash;I loved the man as if he was almost sent from heaven&mdash;we
                            had much serious talk &amp; what he said to me was like a refreshing
                            shower on parched up earth" (<em>Memoir</em>, 48).
                        When Savery is discussed in contemporary biographies, her
                        feelings about him become the proper response of a pupil. Yet June Rose calls it an &ldquo;infatuation&rdquo; with the
                        married, middle-aged preacher, one that Betsy's sisters teased her about.
                            During a trip to London, she contrived to see
                                Savery, one morning even waiting in the parlor of the
                            house where he was staying until she met him.
                        Rose writes: &ldquo;Through her journal in London runs the thread of William Savery
                        and religion. She
                            realized that the two were dangerously intertwined. . . . In
                        religion she found an outlet for her highly emotional and hypersensitive
                        nature but she had come to religion through a man&rdquo; (24). This compromising
                        piece of her religious enlightenment never emerges in nineteenth-century versions.</p>
<p class="">Part of
                        Betsy's development towards Plain
                            Quakerism involved adopting the Society's strict rules for inner
                        discipline, which prohibited dancing, singing and all ornamental attire. Her
                        determination placed her at uncomfortable odds with her family, who found
                        her refusal to join in with their pleasures irritating and disapproved of
                        her obsession with religion. Instead,
                            like many ladies of her class, she turned her attention towards the
                            needs of the poor around her and opened a Sunday school where she read Gospel stories
                            and gave lessons to local children.
                        Betsy gradually adopted the outward appearance
                        of Plain Quakerism, publicly wearing the cap (that would later be the
                        distinguishing feature of her famed image) for the first time in
                            1799 at a party given by her cousins in London (Rose, 33). The hagiographical versions insist that Fry&rsquo;s public act of embracing
                        Plain Quakerism&rsquo;s garb signaled her rejection of all selfish, materialistic
                        pleasures. June Rose suggests otherwise. Fry, after purchasing
                        extravagant cloth to make ordinary aprons, writes in her memoir: &ldquo;It
                            seems inconsistent to dress plain from principle and economy and then
                            have my things so fine and expensive,&rdquo; but according to Rose, Fry
                        allowed herself to indulge in this contradiction between principle and
                        practice all her life (35). She always wore dresses that appeared sober, being
                            simple in design and muted in color; yet, less conspicuous to the eye,
                            her clothing was made from the finest, most expensive fabrics. Rose
                            notes that the characteristic brown silk shawl, which accompanied the
                            famous cap, was lined inside with ermine (35). And Fry was
                        certainly conscientious of her public appearance: when traveling through Europe as a celebrated philanthropist, a
                            member of Fry's party sat on and disfigured her expensive, new Quaker
                            cap, almost spelling disaster for the entire trip. Fortunately, some
                            quick thinking ladies in the group managed to rescue the cap from its
                            flattened condition (Rose, 188).
                    </p>
<p class="">On
                            August 19th, 1800, after much deliberation about the
                        conflict between religious calling and matrimonial duties, as well as a
                        courtship lengthened by her own indecision, Elizabeth married Joseph Fry, a shy, complacent man
                        from a wealthy Quaker family. It was at about this same time
                        that she started to speak in Society Meetings and read aloud from the
                        Bible&mdash;developing the public voice that was key to her later ministry (in
                            1811 the Society formally acknowledged her as a Quaker
                        Minister). This activity coincided and inevitably conflicted with twenty-two years of
                        prolific childbearing: ten children between 1801 and
                            1816, and an eleventh in 1822. According to Rose, Elizabeth's
                        journal reveals how unsuited she was to domesticity and childrearing,
                            worldly concerns that she felt detracted from her
                        true religious calling. While she expressed regret over her lack of
                        sympathetic feeling as a wife and mother, her own talents and interests
                        inclined toward public ministry. As she became increasingly
                        devoted to philanthropic work, frequently traveling abroad on her mission to reform
                            prison systems, Elizabeth left her family behind.
                        Joseph Fry, weaker-willed than his
                        determined wife, supervised the rearing of their youngest children while the
                        older ones where sent to live with relatives. The children were ill-behaved
                        and self-willed; later, Elizabeth would see all but one of them reject
                        Quaker strictures by marrying outside of the sect. Although she was lauded
                        for her public service, family members and Quaker Society friends
                        criticized her for neglecting the domestic duties of marriage and
                        motherhood. </p>
<p class="">Rose bluntly analyzes Fry's conflict between private and
                        public duties: &ldquo;It was necessary for her to see her work as divinely inspired, for it
                        was only through her religion, through her status as a Minister, that she
                        could <em>emancipate herself</em> and leave the domestic sphere with any peace of
                        mind&rdquo;(92, emphasis added). Perhaps ungenerously, Rose asserts that
                            Fry preferred public ministry because it
                        attracted the attention of a rapt audience; having been desperate for notice
                        as a child in a large family, she refused her own numerous children the
                        attention they needed from her. The collective biographies avoid confronting
                        any neglect the children suffered while their mother exerted herself in
                        public philanthropy. Calling Elizabeth Fry a &ldquo;ministering angel to her
                        fellow-creatures,&rdquo; Mossman's sketch focuses on
                        her charitable labors, only alluding to the fellow-creatures of her own home
                        in a final gloss: &ldquo;She believed in some instances, her own amongst
                        other, that, under the immediate
                            direction of the Spirit of God, individuals were called to leave for
                        a time their home and families, and devote themselves to the work of the
                        ministry&rdquo; (81). Mossman's comment has striking
                        parallels to Rose, yet only the more recent biographer indicts
                        Elizabeth Fry's personal motivations in her public calling and considers
                        that her conscious choice to &ldquo;emancipate herself&rdquo; neglected her family&rsquo;s
                        development. </p>
<p class="">The
                        development of others, especially of female prison inmates, became Elizabeth's primary concern. In
                            1813, accompanied by Anna Buxton, she first entered Newgate Penitentiary, where she saw women, both hardened criminals
                        and minor offenders, detained together with their innocent children. They
                        perceived that the conditions&mdash;gambling, drinking and brawls between the
                        women&mdash;only further degraded the morals of the inmates and corrupted their
                        children's minds, whose first words were to repeat the vulgar language they
                        daily heard. Immediately, she and her friend set to work providing
                        much-needed clothing and clean bedding for the prisoners and Elizabeth read
                        the Bible aloud to them during the visits. Four years later, she would
                        return to Newgate with her mind set on reforming the conditions for female
                        inmates and rehabilitating them by way of a radical system of discipline.
                            In a move
                        that was extremely progressive for the time, Elizabeth addressed the women
                        directly and asked for their consent before instituting her new system,
                        which set up schools and provided
                        inmates with paid labor opportunities. She allowed them to vote on the rules
                        of discipline (which prohibited drinking and gambling) before they were
                        adopted. The change she effected at Newgate won
                        her public renown: turning a group of fallen women, once considered unruly
                        beasts, into lady-like women who diligently applied their needles to sewing
                        and knitting for an honest living. Biographers often link Elizabeth Fry&rsquo;s reformation of Newgate with an
                        emblem that was also applied to missionary martyr <a href="featured%3Fid=ANN_HASSELTINE_JUDSON.html">Ann Hasseltine
                            Judson</a>: the heroine carrying a civilizing light into darkness.
                        The narrative effect of this emblem is heightened by a detail from
                        Elizabeth&rsquo;s journal: during her conversion, she tried to overcome her childhood fear of darkness,
                        conditioning herself to the dark by remaining alone in rooms at night (<em>Memoir</em>, 84). </p>
<p class="">The fable of Elizabeth
                        Fry's entry into Newgate is lovingly retold by presenters who conflate
                        details and heighten her heroism. Almost universally in
                        these biographical fictions, she enters the prison alone, &ldquo;her only shield her
                            faith and purity&mdash;her sole weapons the charity that hopeth all things,
                            believeth all things, and a copy of the New Testament opened in her
                            hand&rdquo; (Russell, 16-17). To the jailer who warned her not to go
                            amongst the unruly women, or if she must, to leave her purse and watch
                            in his safekeeping, she is said to reply &ldquo;I am not afraid&rdquo;
                        (or, if scared, overcoming it with miraculous fortitude) and to show no
                        concern about her valuables. Adams and Foster
                        even write that such was the impression Elizabeth made on her first visit,
                        &ldquo;far from being robbed, when she dropped some article a woman ran after her
                        to restore it&rdquo; (16). According to Rose, Elizabeth did in fact
                        leave her watch with the jailer for safekeeping (68-71). Nearly all accounts
                            condense the first visit in January of 1813 with her later
                            return at Christmas of 1816, presumably to create the idea
                            of her immediate (and thus more heroic) intercession to alleviate the
                            appalling conditions she found at Newgate.</p>
<p class="">Elizabeth
                        Fry's untiring reform work was heroic, without need to resort to eulogy.
                            Defying the opinions of the male
                            institutional leaders, she showed at Newgate that her compassionate
                        system of discipline transformed inmates, and she pressed the Lord Mayor of London for its official adoption into the prison system
                        (a move that guaranteed funding from the government). In 1818,
                        she was the first woman asked to testify in the House of Commons, providing evidence from the
                        Newgate system before a Committee on London Prisons. Elizabeth organized a
                        women's group, The Association for the Improvement of the Female Prisoners
                        in Newgate, and traveled across Britain encouraging socially prominent women to form their own local
                        Ladies' Associations&mdash;in 1821 Elizabeth's Newgate organization
                        was expanded into the British Ladies' Society for Promoting the Reformation
                        of Female Prisoners, possibly Britain's first nationwide women's activist
                        group (Haan, ODNB). Later in her career, she traveled extensively in Europe and influenced sovereigns and ministers to follow
                        her ideas about improving prison conditions and rehabilitating inmates. </p>
<p class="">Prison reform
                        was not her only mission, although Newgate and her system of female
                        discipline were what propelled Elizabeth Fry to public celebrity. collective
                        biographies that compiled eminent figures into narratives of female heroism
                        naturally focused on the legend of Newgate, an irresistible image of
                        triumph. Yet Elizabeth Fry felt her calling in many other
                        avenues: she extended her system of female discipline and schooling onto
                        convict ships that transported exiled prisoners, and worked to ensure that
                        these women had an honest means of supporting themselves in the colonies;
                            she
                        pushed for better treatment of confined lunatics and spoke out against the
                        practice of solitary confinement; she campaigned against the death
                        penalty and succeeded in its being abolished as a punishment for minor
                        offenses; she used her influence to create temporary shelter where hundreds
                        of paupers were housed and fed in the winter of 1819; she
                        advocated for religious toleration; she established libraries for the
                        edification of England's coastguard; she delivered innumerable
                        religious tracts for the Bible Society; she established the Society of
                        Nursing Sisters in 1840 and created a training school with the aim of reforming nurse
                        work&mdash;a group of &ldquo;Fry nurses&rdquo; were amongst <a href="featured%3Fid=FLORENCE_NIGHTINGALE.html">Florence
                            Nightingale's</a> party that went to Scutari during the Crimean War (Rose, 180). Elizabeth Fry is
                        even considered today as a protofeminist, her call for the formation of
                        Ladies' Committees being seen as a precursor to an organized women's
                        movement (Haan, ODNB). </p>
<p class="">Nevertheless, the commendation in collective biographies suppresses further
                        aspects of Elizabeth Fry's life: on doctor&rsquo;s orders, she
                        took opium and drank alcohol daily and by the end of her life seems to have
                        become heavily dependent; in 1828, John Fry's
                        bank went under and he
                        was disowned by the Society of Friends, while Elizabeth was accused of having
                        drawn funds from her husband's bank to support her charities (Rose, 138-9).
                        Yet not all that is conspicuously missing from the biographies concerns
                        unpleasant details from her private life. No presenter takes notice of the
                        public opposition her work received from later, secular men who were
                        professionally engaged in reforming social policy. These male reformers
                        passed over Elizabeth Fry's legacy as amateur charity work done by an
                        old-fashioned, Plain Quaker woman (Haan, ODNB). Thus, the picture we have
                        from contemporary biographies is double-edged. It may be a carefully-crafted
                        figure of moral heroism, diminishing the full human being Elizabeth Fry.
                        Yet, if these early biographers had not canonized her in print during the
                            nineteenth century, her name and
                        its connection to humanitarian reform might have been lost, trampled by the
                        steady and impersonal march of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; in modern society.</p>
<p class="">On October
                            13th, 1845, Elizabeth died after suffering a stroke. Over a thousand
                        people attended the funeral held at the Quaker burial ground at Barking to pay their respects to this
                        remarkable woman, a religious outsider yet of a prominent, wealthy family,
                        who had become a saintly figure of pious dedication and compassionate
                        philanthropy. The heroine Elizabeth Fry was not just a Christian worker who
                        ministered to those she saw in need, but was publicly recognized as an
                        influential prison reformer&mdash;at a time when it was unprecedented for a
                        woman to be actively involved in structuring social policy. </p>
