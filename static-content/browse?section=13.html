<p class="notepara">Frontispiece of Louis XIV.  A one-page "Preface to the French Edition" is translated.  Numerous glossy illustrations
      reproducing court portraits or printed engraved portraits in annotated frames. About six pages of bibliography, French sources.  Someone has taped the edges of a batik-
      style printed paper overlaid on the cloth covers (not the spine): a beige grid of purple squares with beige diamonds inside.  The tone of the narratives resembles
      emotional romance fiction; there is little acknowledgment of historical speculation (motives and thoughts are asserted).  An exception: "What was the reason why Marei-
      Magdeleine, at the age of twenty-two, had never had an offer of marriage?  In the first place she was poor...even in our own times we have numbers of girls...
      compelled to remain old maids.  For it is quite an open question whether Marie-Magdeleine had any claims to good-looks" (169).</p>

<b>Luckett, Margie

       King,
       1931 (v. 1);
       1937 (v. 2)
       1942 (v. 3).
      
      <p class="notepara">First volume (517 pages); following, 417 and 444 pages respectively.  Bound in black with the Maryland
      seal on the front cover in gold.  Margie H. Luckett, "Editor and Publisher," appears to have signed each title page; this is supported by the bookplates
      of the Library of the University of Virginia: "Presented by Mrs. Edmund Boone Luckett" (typed).  She appears in the frontispiece of the third volume, captioned Mrs. Edmond Boone Luckett, The Author, where in volume one Queen Henrietta
      Maria and in volume two Queen Anne appeared. Each volume is dedicated to one of Mrs. Luckett's daughters.  The third volume differs in a glossy insert
      between copyright and dedication pages: the lyrics to the Star-Spangled Banner, facing a color image of the flag above the Pledge of Allegiance.  This
      seems likely to be prompted by the war ongoing in 1942.  The brief "Foreword" to v. 3 states: "Responding to a continued demand for Maryland Women,
      the author has compiled the third volume; this volume before leaving the press has been ordered by different universities, to be placed by volume 1 and volume
      2 as reference books.  The author has derived great pleasure in the contact of these native and adopted Maryland Women.  To quote Carlyle, who said, 'he 
      would give more for a single picture of a man than all the books that might be written of him.'"  Short alphabetical entries (indexed) take very different 
      forms, suggesting self- or family-contributed bios, most with glossy photographs of the subject.  The contents appear almost entirely distinct in each
      volume, though the daughter Elise Luckett Balsam, featured in volume one, has an obituary in volume three (sadly inserted with her beautiful portrait
      and paginated "6A"), and one Mrs. John Nicholas Brown (Anne Kinsolving), misplaced in the alphabet at the very end of volume one, reappears 3: 23.  These
      appear all to be white women; some could be Jewish, though this is not remarked; a number have careers in music, the arts, journalism, even sky-diving,
      and at least one is a suffrage advocate.  Some portraits show pageantry, as women play the role of queens or the Goddess of Liberty (3: 28).  The inclusion
      of English nobility and royalty goes along with a frequent insistence on genealogy and membership in the Daughters of the American Revolution.</p>
